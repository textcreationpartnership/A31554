            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </byline>
               <p>I Was in earneſt, and am ſo ſtill, and have too much reaſon to be ſo, and deſire nothing but <hi>a clear Stage,</hi> and <hi>no Quarter.</hi> I ſhall begin my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack on that which is the very Foundation of all your Sexes Pride, and the Dotage and Folly of our own, and that's <hi>LOVE,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41990:6"/>which I undertake to prove, none but a Fool can e'er be guilty of.</hi> I know you'll ask me preſently, whether I never knew a <hi>wiſe Man</hi> in that Condition? I grant, many that are eſteem'd wiſe, may have had a ſhaking or two on't, or have at leaſt thought fit to pretend ſomething like it, to hold their Necks o' one ſide, and look like Fools, that they might not be out of the Faſhion, as our Grandſirs wore Ruffs, our Grannys Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingales, and your ſelves now, ſuch Aerial Monumental Topknots; which tho' you all acknowledge little leſs ridiculous than a Cap with a Bell at the Top of it, yet it the <hi>Seven-Wiſe-Miſtreſſes</hi> ſhould riſe agen, they'd rather never be kiſs'd, than be one Barly-Corn ſhort of the Faſhion. But you'll ſay, they don't all diſſemble; for if <hi>wiſe Men</hi> han't bin really in Love, why do they marry? A ſhrowd Argument. And who ever did ſo that was well in his Wits? 'Tis true, that Men of the greateſt Senſe may ſometimes overſtrain their Heads with think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and get a little <hi>delirious,</hi> and in that <hi>Fit,</hi> Nature falls upon them like a Coward, when they are <hi>down,</hi> and pops 'em into <hi>Matrimony;</hi> and when once their Horns are faſt in the <hi>Brake,</hi> let 'em get out agen how they can. That this is true, you your ſelves muſt grant, or your great Admirers, the <hi>Athenians,</hi> if you'd either of ye be ſo ingenious as to reſolve me one Queſtion, and that is—Whether you ever knew any
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41990:6"/>of thoſe celebrated <hi>Wiſdoms,</hi> who did not play the Fool egregiouſly in ſome one great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their Liſe, and in this I'm ſure as much as any other. You have heard, I ſuppoſe, of one of their Sagacities, who when he had <hi>marry'd</hi> his <hi>Maid,</hi> frankly own'd that there was no reaſon below the Girdle, and he never gave a more <hi>righteous Judgment.</hi> And perhaps 'tis neceſſary that thoſe great Men ſhou'd have ſome ſuch <hi>remarkable Blemiſh</hi> that <hi>others</hi> may <hi>know</hi> them, and they <hi>know</hi> themſelves to be but <hi>Men,</hi> as the Spots in the Sun and Moon, are enough to keep any but Sots from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping 'em; and as the old <hi>Romans,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their long Beards, convinced the <hi>Gauls</hi> at laſt, that they were not Gods, becauſe they were capable of paſſion as well as themſelves. Suppoſe then, at worſt, that a <hi>wiſe Man</hi> ſhould have bin in Love, 'tis as a <hi>Fool,</hi> not a <hi>wiſe Man:</hi> He for the time parts with his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> puts off his <hi>Politic,</hi> and appears in his <hi>Perſonal</hi> Capacity, unleſs you'll rather ſay, that as the Gods are fabled to have done, he <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes</hi> himſelf to deſcend among Mortals. This I ſtill affirm, 'tis no part of his <hi>wiſdom;</hi> he's dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wn into't by a meer <hi>Trick</hi> and <hi>Fallacy</hi> of Nature; 'tis what he wou'd, if he cou'd, <hi>avoid,</hi> like <hi>ſleeping,</hi> or other leſs handſome Actions. 'Tis certain, no <hi>wiſe Man</hi> wou'd ever be in Love, if he knew how to help it, becauſe it makes him look ſo <hi>like</hi> a <hi>Fool,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41990:7"/>that the <hi>two Soſia's</hi> are hardly <hi>leſs diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable.</hi> For muſt not any Man in his right Senſes, (which beſure is no Lover) muſt he not own that upon a fair and equal Ballance, the Inconveniences of that Paſſion infinitely outweigh that <hi>ſcratching</hi> ſort of a Pleaſure, which ſome ſay is to be found in't. Wou'd any <hi>wiſe Man,</hi> I'd fain know, bring a thouſand Miſchiefs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, which he might keep clear of, or make <hi>anothers</hi> Misfortunes his <hi>own,</hi> as if he had not already ſufficient to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him? But he that's not in Love is <hi>half an Angel</hi> to the Wretch, who is condemn'd to row in that Ship of <hi>Fools,</hi> chain'd to ſome other Fellow-Slave, to have and to <hi>hold</hi> with a Vengeance, like thoſe poor Creatures, whom the Tyrant faſtned to <hi>Dead Carcaſſes,</hi> that they might <hi>ſtink</hi> and <hi>rot</hi> together. The Story of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor's</hi> Box is doubtleſs miſtold by the Poets: 'Twas the <hi>Dreſſing Box,</hi> which Nature preſented to all your Sex, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, as I hope to prove, I know not how many hundred Kinds of Poyſons, Miſchiefs and Miſeries, intruſted all in your Hands, to puniſh and plague Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. I'd fain know to what peice of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifry a Man muſt have recourſe, to find all the Diſeaſes of your <hi>Bodies</hi> only, (ſince theſe of your <hi>Minds</hi> are granted innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) with which, if a Man has the hard Fate not to be <hi>choakt</hi> or <hi>poyſon'd</hi> the firſt Night,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41990:7"/>as a certain King they talk of uſed to ſerve his Wives, yet how many a tedious Moon and Year, and Age, muſt he lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh with ſome frightful Hag <hi>ruſtling</hi> by his ſide, unleſs he takes a Doſe of Opium to break the Charm, and give him his <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas Corpus</hi> to an eaſier, and more comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Bed in the Duſt? 'Tis one of the leaſt and moſt tollerable Inconveniences of that whimfical Paſſion, that it turns the Brains of all it ſeizes, and makes 'em ſo ridiculous, that 'tis impoſſible to pity 'em, without laughing at 'em.</p>
               <p>And the worſt of it is, that this Madneſs is infectious too, and better come near any other Venemous Creature than a Lover:— For not only his Bite, or his <hi>Sight,</hi> is <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> but 'tis almoſt equally dangerous to <hi>hear</hi> him. His <hi>Sighs</hi> kill as certainly as the <hi>Breath</hi> of a <hi>Serpent,</hi> and infuſe the <hi>ſame</hi> Poiſon into others, which he himſelf was ſo full of, that it runs over. To ſpeak truth, he's not only a public Nuiſance, but a common Enemy, and deſerves as well to be expell'd a regular Commonwealth, as the Poets from <hi>Plato</hi>'s, or as that <hi>Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> who put a whole City into a Fever, by reciting a Famous Tragedy. All wiſe Law-givers have taken a peculiar Care to puniſh thoſe very ſeverely, who have bin Corrupters of Manners, and by their bad Examples, debauch'd the Commonwealth, and infected it with Riot and Lewdneſs.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41990:8"/>But nothing effeminates a Man more than this ſickly Paſſion; nay, it makes him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe or hate all who are healthier and wiſer, and will have it a mark of Dullneſs and Nonſence, not to play the Fool, and is as angry with thoſe who do not, as the <hi>Sybarite</hi> with the poor honeſt Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, who was hard at work; which ſo highly diſpleaſed him, that he was like to have beaten him, becauſe it made him ſweat to look upon him. The ſubject is ſo copious, that I find 'tis eaſier to ſay too much than enough upon't; I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore add no more, but one juſt Remark, that 'tis eaſie to obſerve what an uſeful and innocent Paſſion we ought to eſteem it, when we find nothing more common than for the Raviſher, the Inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the Adulterer, and ſometimes the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, to plead <hi>Love,</hi> to excuſe them, which therefore ſhou'd ſeem not only a Pretence for the blacheſt Villanies, but even the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of them.</p>

               </byline>
               <p>ALL Men muſt Love, and this Sir you grant, and that Nature it ſelf obliges 'em to do ſo, which if true, it muſt be <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Rational,</hi> and the contrary <hi>unnatural,</hi> then which nothing more can be deſir'd to the prejudice of your opinion; nor can any thing be pleaded more to the Advantage of Love then that 'tis neceſſary in our preſent State of Life. When we come to be Angels 'tis another matter, but what's that to thoſe that make the objection? Would not a Man deſire to <hi>Eat</hi> and <hi>Sleep</hi> when he has occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and if he ſhou'd quarrel with Nature for obliging him to it, wou'd he not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by highly bring in Queſtion both his <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> it being no leſs then taking it ill, that he's made a <hi>Man,</hi> not a Stone, or a Tree (tho even they <hi>Love</hi> too, in their way) or a ſenceleſs Lump of Earth, when ſhe was at Liberty into what mould ſhe'd caſt his yet <hi>undetermin'd matter?</hi> What is there ſtronger, more certain, or more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable and wonderful then Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Inſtinct? But had the Loadſtone that <hi>Reaſon</hi> we boaſt of, 'twou'd ſurely make better uſe on't then to find fault with Nature for making it ſo dearly Love
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41990:9"/>the Iron. But there's more then this in't, there's ſomething highly rational in the very <hi>Eſſence</hi> of <hi>virtuous Love,</hi> abſtracted from that muddy <hi>ſence</hi> we have been ſo long talking of, tho the objection makes it all nothing elſe, as if Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> had no Notion of any purer Love, and yet it concludes againſt Love in General, which is by no means a fair way of arguing. If there be no reaſon <hi>below</hi> the <hi>Girdle,</hi> ſure there's ſome above it, or elſe we are in a worſe condition then thoſe which ſome eſteem their <hi>Fellow-Reaſoners,</hi> and <hi>Fellow-Lovers</hi> too, if they Love promiſcuouſly and make it all a matter of <hi>ſence</hi> only. But that there's ſomething more refin'd in <hi>Love,</hi> is evident to any, who will but be at the pains to reflect on the <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of it, and nothing is more certain then that the <hi>mind</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> perceives it is not, nor can be in it ſelf compleatly happy. It therefore looks <hi>abroad,</hi> coaſts about, and ſurveys the whole Creation, as the firſt Man did in <hi>Innocence,</hi> to ſeek for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it and ſuitable to it, till it meets at laſt with ſome <hi>imbody'd Soul,</hi> and that it Loves, for were it the body only, 'twou'd Love a <hi>Carcaſs</hi> as well as an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, at leaſt <hi>one Perſon</hi> as well as another, the contrary whereof is evident to all the World, and that only Brutes, or thoſe who are very near 'em, have no choice in theſe matters: It finds, 'tis true, no <hi>perfect
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41990:9"/>ſatisfaction</hi> in what it <hi>Loves,</hi> even when it poſſeſſes it; and what's the reaſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Body lags behind, comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, and obſtructs its happineſs; no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weakneſs then is to be found in all ſenſible pleaſures. But the reaſonableneſs of Love reaches further: The ſympathy of <hi>Souls</hi> is <hi>rational,</hi> and we are conſcious of it, and can reflect upon it; there's not only, as has been ſaid, ſomething of <hi>choice,</hi> but even of delicacy in't, whereas there's none in any <hi>Magnet</hi> either <hi>Dead</hi> or <hi>Living,</hi> a ſubject indeed fit to be wrote upon by none but a Tranſported Lover.</p>
               <p>However, nothing can be weaker then the remaining objections, which this angry Gentleman produces againſt that beſt of paſſions, the direct contrary to moſt of what he aſſerts being evidently true. He calls it a <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>azy</hi> diſtemper, when 'tis the moſt <hi>Active Principle</hi> in the World; wou'd perſwade us that no <hi>Wiſe man</hi> is, or <hi>wou'd</hi> be in <hi>Love,</hi> whence it follows by the Rule of contrarys, that either <hi>hatred,</hi> or at leaſt a ſtoical <hi>Apathy wou'd</hi> better become him, which needs no confutation. So far is <hi>Love</hi> from being an Argument of <hi>Folly,</hi> that we defy him to inſtance in a <hi>Fool</hi> that ever was in <hi>Love.</hi> Tho o' t'other ſide, he knows the ſtory of the Aſs in the <hi>Turkiſh-Spy,</hi> and we leave him to apply it. And as this <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> to <hi>Love</hi> is no great <hi>ſign</hi> of <hi>wit,</hi> ſo 'tis no better of <hi>Civility</hi> and <hi>Humanity.</hi> For
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41990:10"/>which reaſon, when we find a perſon who really has all thoſe qualifications, fall foul on that well-natur'd paſſion, we may well believe one of theſe two things, either that 'tis only a <hi>Copy</hi> of his <hi>Countenance,</hi> only as a Tryal of Skill and oſtentation of his <hi>Wit,</hi> to ſhow how much he can ſay for an <hi>ill cauſe,</hi> or elſe that his mind is <hi>ſowr'd</hi> by having been himſelf <hi>unfortunate</hi> in his amours, in which caſe he's a prejudic'd Perſon, and an unproper Judge, and as little regard is to be given to his <hi>Ravings</hi> as he has for Truth or Juſtice. But let ſuch as theſe ſay what they will, the World will be ſtill apt to believe their ſences, and when they have ſo often ſeen ſuch as have been nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Liberal or Courtly, nor Induſtrious, nor it may be ſo much as neat or cleanly before they have fallen in <hi>Love,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after reform'd as it were by Miracle, and become quite other Men, and when their difference from themſelves has been and often is ſo Remarkable, and the Change ſo much for the better, and they become both Generous and Liberal, and Courtly and Diligent, who can hinder himſelf from concluding that it muſt be a Noble Principle, and very Beneficial to Mankind, which cauſes ſuch an Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious alteration? But above all, the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he caſts upon Love, none appears more unjuſt or improbable then his charging it with effeminating Mens minds; when 'tis
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41990:10"/>Notorious that it does the contrary, and that ſometimes to a Fault; and that even a <hi>Timorous Heart</hi> will not refuſe to <hi>fight</hi> when his <hi>Miſtreſi</hi> is near him.</p>
               <p>As for the Gentlemans <hi>Civil Farewell,</hi> wherein he throws all thoſe miſchiefs upon Love, whereof 'tis either the innocent, or but pretended occaſion, he can't but be ſatisfy'd himſelf 'tis a very unfair way of <hi>Arguing,</hi> ſince if that wou'd hold good, we'd fain know how he cou'd Anſwer an objection much of the ſame nature brought againſt <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf, the pretence of which all muſt own has been the occaſion of much miſchief in the World. But the ſame An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer will ſerve to both; 'Tis not <hi>Religion,</hi> nor is it <hi>Love</hi> that really occaſion theſe fatal diſorders, but the <hi>pretence,</hi> the abuſe, the <hi>Vizard</hi> of 'em both, nor will it ever be otherwiſe, but that <hi>Villains</hi> will <hi>Profane</hi> and Scandalize <hi>one</hi> of theſe as well as the <hi>other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after all, what wou'd the objector gain ſhou'd we grant that Love were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch a Bugbear as he has repreſented it, or how come Women more then Men to be concern'd in't? O— he tells us in the Beginning, 'tis "this which is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Female Sexes Pride, as well as of the <hi>Dotage</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> of <hi>Mans.</hi> But was there never a <hi>Beau</hi> of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance who grew Proud and Vain with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Belov'd,</hi> nay, with the very <hi>Fancy</hi> and

                  <hi>Dream</hi> on't, having ſo good an opinion of the <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Good humour</hi> of his own <hi>Wig</hi> and <hi>Cravat,</hi> that he thinks 'tis im poſſible any Lady in the World ſhou'd reſiſt him? Such Monſters as theſe he knows have been found, out of <hi>Africa,</hi> and 'tis not at all fair to lay the weight of a Folly that ought to be divided between both Sexes, on <hi>one</hi> only, and that the <hi>weaker</hi> too, eſpecially when ſo great a part of Men have ſo much their own <hi>good word,</hi> that if the Ladies ſhou'd not take pity on 'em, and let 'em now and then make <hi>Love</hi> to them, or at leaſt to their <hi>Fan,</hi> or <hi>Picture,</hi> they wou'd infallibly fall in Love with their own <hi>dear ſelves,</hi> and like <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus,</hi> ſtare ſo long on their own <hi>ſhadows,</hi> till they pin'd themſelves to Death.</p>

               <byline>By Sir <hi>THOMAS—</hi>
               </byline>
               <p>A Vaſt <hi>Sea</hi> to <hi>Launch</hi> into, and not more <hi>wide</hi> then 'tis <hi>unfathomable:</hi> They are indeed but <hi>one,</hi> tho diſtinguiſh'd by differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Names,</hi> or at leaſt have a mutual <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> and flow into each other. But for more <hi>exactneſs</hi> I'll diſcourſe of them <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly,</hi> and deſcribe the dangerous <hi>Rocks</hi> and <hi>Sands</hi> and <hi>Shelves,</hi> that are every where ſcatter'd round 'em, that tho you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to <hi>ſink</hi> your ſelves, others at leaſt may <hi>beware</hi> of 'em.</p>
               <p>And firſt, your <hi>Pride,</hi> which you know was your <hi>Fall,</hi> as well as that of your dear <hi>confident,</hi> who <hi>perſwaded</hi> you to it. 'Tis hard to ſay, where you ſhow it moſt, in your <hi>Converſation</hi> with <hi>us,</hi> or with your <hi>ſelves,</hi> or with <hi>one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While you have <hi>Eyes,</hi> you will have <hi>Pride,</hi> you have ſufficient in your ſelves to feed that, and your <hi>vanity,</hi> tho no other living Eye ſhou'd ever ſee you. Is it for your <hi>Husbands,</hi> or ſo much as your <hi>Lovers,</hi> or for the ſake of the reſt of the World,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41990:12"/>that's all this <hi>Patching</hi> and <hi>Painting,</hi> and <hi>Curling</hi> and <hi>Dreſſing,</hi> and <hi>Fooling?</hi> No, I muſt clear you from all theſe; 'Tis as much for your own <hi>dear ſelves</hi> you do it, as for all the reſt together. We fancy the <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k</hi> ſpreads his <hi>fine Train</hi> to oblige the <hi>Spectators,</hi> but it's a great miſtake, for he does it often enough, and <hi>ſtares</hi> on himſelf, and admires his <hi>glaring Train,</hi> when he knows not he has any <hi>Witneſſes</hi> to admire him.</p>
               <p>Thus wou'd you do, if in a <hi>room</hi> by your ſelves, and you were ſure neither to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> or <hi>make</hi> any <hi>viſits;</hi> you'd yet <hi>ruſtle,</hi> and <hi>ftrut,</hi> and look back on your <hi>Train,</hi> and mend your <hi>Curles,</hi> and make Court to your own <hi>amiable ſelves,</hi> for a whole day together.</p>
               <p>However, as to your <hi>outſide</hi> you have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſomewhat that may at leaſt give a pretence to your <hi>Vanity,</hi> but what have you to ſay, for your <hi>minds?</hi> What ſhow or ſhadow of Reaſon, for being <hi>Proud</hi> of what is ſo perfectly <hi>Contemptible,</hi> and there's ſo little <hi>hopes,</hi> or it may be <hi>poſſibility,</hi> of their ever amending? You are even <hi>Proud</hi> of your <hi>own Pride,</hi> when you can find nothing elſe, and you thus make a ſort of an <hi>infinite Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs</hi> in <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Folly.</hi> Your Sex reconciles a thouſand <hi>Contradictions,</hi> which is it ſelf the <hi>greateſt,</hi> your minds are <hi>weak</hi> and yet <hi>ſtubborn, looſe</hi> and <hi>diſſolv'd,</hi> and open to ſuch <hi>pleaſing ſophiſtry</hi> as you are ſure will <hi>ruine</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:41990:12"/>you, and yet at the ſame time <hi>impregnable</hi> againſt the utmoſt <hi>efforts</hi> of <hi>ſober</hi> reaſon, mighty <hi>full</hi> of your <hi>ſelves,</hi> and yet as noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly <hi>empty</hi> as thoſe <hi>ſhapes</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> who ſo much admire you. I ſhall find you a <hi>Glaſs,</hi> e'er I've left ye, better then Mrs. <hi>Behn's,</hi> and much truer; and which, if you'd look upon't half as often as on your own, there would be ſome hopes you might a little rectify theſe <hi>mental De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities;</hi> but I'm perſwaded you are much more inclin'd to <hi>break</hi> it, for you never yet <hi>endur</hi>'d one that <hi>told</hi> you your <hi>Faults,</hi> any more then a <hi>Gown</hi> that ſhows your <hi>Ill ſhapes,</hi> you dearly Love to be <hi>bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>'d, and he or none muſt have your <hi>Heart</hi> that <hi>flatters</hi> and <hi>abuſes</hi> ye.</p>
               <p>But I'm ſlipt from your <hi>Pride</hi> to your <hi>Vanity,</hi> which ſeems to <hi>reſpect others,</hi> while the former is often <hi>terminated</hi> on your ſelves; Tho 'twill be as difficult to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate one from t'other, as you from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore I muſt now conſider 'em <hi>promiſcuouſly,</hi> and take that which comes uppermoſt.</p>
               <p>And if ever either of 'em ſhow'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, 'tis in your pretences to <hi>equality</hi> with your <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Soveraign;</hi> that <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler Creature,</hi> whom you were made to <hi>ſerve</hi> and <hi>obey,</hi> a ſort of an <hi>Appendix</hi> you are to Mankind, a <hi>Crutch</hi> to his <hi>Mortal Nature,</hi> made (one wou'd be tempted to think) on <hi>Praviſion</hi> of the <hi>Fall</hi> (had not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41990:13"/>you your ſelves been the <hi>Principal Actors</hi> in it,) without which one can ſcarce ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine there had been any <hi>need</hi> of you. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>made</hi> you were, for <hi>another,</hi> and yet have the <hi>Vanity</hi> to flatter your ſelves, that <hi>he</hi> was rather <hi>form'd</hi> for <hi>you,</hi> and that all Mankind are to bow <hi>down</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> ye. O! How hard it goes to pay a little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>bodily obedience,</hi> but if it once comes to the <hi>mind,</hi> you'll no more yeild any <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority</hi> then a begging <hi>Spaniard;</hi> to a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman</hi> of any other <hi>Nation.</hi> There you are perfect <hi>Levellers,</hi> as fit to <hi>rule</hi> as any, and as much <hi>right</hi> to't, tho you may as well ſay your <hi>Bodies</hi> are as <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and can undergo as much <hi>Fatigue</hi> as ours.</p>
               <p>How many poor Husbands d' you make <hi>weary</hi> of their <hi>Lives</hi> by the <hi>Pride,</hi> the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs,</hi> and the <hi>Vanity</hi> of your <hi>Tempers,</hi> and what <hi>Bunches</hi> of 'em have <hi>ſtrung</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on this occaſion?</p>
               <p>And no wonder, if you ſeldom miſs <hi>trying</hi> your skill with them, after you have clos'd them, at the ſafe <hi>Lock of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> when you are generally ſo well practis'd in <hi>Domineering</hi> before you are Marry'd. Your <hi>Lovers</hi> are your <hi>Slaves,</hi> from the very firſt ſight, and you rule 'em more <hi>abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> when once <hi>Chain'd</hi> to your <hi>Bed,</hi> then the <hi>Algereens</hi> theirs, when faſten'd to their <hi>Gally-Benches.</hi> Your <hi>concern</hi> is not ſo much, what <hi>ſubjects</hi> you have, as how <hi>many;</hi> nor how they <hi>live,</hi> as how they <hi>ſerve,</hi> nor how
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41990:13"/>you <hi>come</hi> by 'em, as how you may <hi>preſerve</hi> 'em. You have the <hi>Vanity</hi> to believe all that theſe ſay of you, all the groſs <hi>Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> wherewith they load you, with which Tyrants are generally pleas'd, becauſe they think greater things of <hi>themſelves,</hi> then they can hear from others. How many <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries</hi> are you <hi>Guilty</hi> of? Both all your <hi>own,</hi> and theirs too, who are ſo unfortunate, to be enſlav'd by your fatal artifices. They muſt be deeply <hi>forſworn</hi> to pleaſe you, and proteſt you have ten thouſand <hi>charms</hi> they never dreamt of, tho your <hi>Faces</hi> be as <hi>mean</hi> as your <hi>minds.</hi> And if theſe happen to be <hi>Blaſphem'd,</hi> if any whom you are grown <hi>weary</hi> of, and have <hi>caſt</hi> 'em off for the ſake of beloved <hi>variety,</hi> happens to take the <hi>ungenteel Freedom</hi> to ſlander you with the greateſt <hi>Truth,</hi> what <hi>attonement</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but his Blood, and what <hi>Sacrifice</hi> leſs then <hi>humane,</hi> to appeaſe your <hi>Savage Deity!</hi> One Rival is preſently hired with <hi>ſmiles</hi> and <hi>hopes,</hi> and all the <hi>Witchcraft</hi> of your <hi>Sex,</hi> to cut the <hi>Throat</hi> of another, to gratify your <hi>infernal Pride,</hi> and <hi>inſatiable revenge:</hi> Whereby you have often a <hi>dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advantage;</hi> you get rid of two Lovers at once, and make <hi>room</hi> for more, while one of 'em is <hi>hang'd</hi> and the other <hi>murther'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor have your own Sex much fairer <hi>Quarter</hi> from you then <hi>ours.</hi> No <hi>Truth,</hi> nor <hi>Juſtice,</hi> nor <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> you are all in <hi>Hobbs</hi> his State of Nature, <hi>Independent Empires</hi> of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41990:14"/>your ſelves, and at profeſs'd <hi>Wars</hi> with all the World. Your very <hi>Cloaths,</hi> your <hi>Gowns,</hi> much more your <hi>Faces</hi> are <hi>Rivals:</hi> You'd ſcarce one of ye, give another an <hi>Inch</hi> of <hi>preheminence,</hi> tho 'twas upon the <hi>Edge</hi> of a <hi>precipice,</hi> and to ſave both your <hi>Lives;</hi> ſo much leſs <hi>wit</hi> have you then the two <hi>poor Goats,</hi> who meeting upon a <hi>narrow Bridge,</hi> and finding it impoſſible to <hi>paſs by</hi> one another, or to <hi>return</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>falling</hi> into the <hi>River,</hi> one of 'em very <hi>politickly</hi> and <hi>humbly</hi> laid himſelf down, and the other <hi>went over</hi> him, by which both got ſafely whither they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. And did they not Act far more like <hi>rational Creatures,</hi> then the two <hi>Good Wives</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> t'other day, who met in a <hi>narrow ſtreet</hi> and complimented till <hi>Night,</hi> getting both <hi>Dinner</hi> and <hi>Supper</hi> in their <hi>Leathern-Tabernacle;</hi> rather then either of 'em wou'd leſſen the <hi>Grandeur</hi> of their <hi>Family</hi> by going backward, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other in <hi>poſſeſſion.</hi>

               <p>You ſhow us, how little <hi>Beauty</hi> is to be really valu'd by the low <hi>eſteem</hi> you have of it in any but your <hi>ſelves.</hi> Some <hi>fault</hi> you are ſure to find in the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Face, and then, none but <hi>all the World</hi> knows it.</p>

                  <q>Yes, truly, ſhe's a pretty ſort of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man enough, for what there is of her, for a little Apple Childiſh Face. Or elſe, on my word a proper Dame, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41990:14"/>ſhape ſhe has to recommend her, ſhe'd make a good handſome Man enough, that's the Truth on't. Or the contrary, were ſhe not a thought to ſlender, a little d'ye call't, (<hi>crys another Erynis),</hi> why ſhe's a MEER SPIDER, a perfect INSECT, two Pyramids ſet together. Or, ſhe has a good Complexion, Nay, ſet down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, 't has a notable Eye of the WALL in't; either DOUGHBAK'T, or the OVEN OVER-HEATED. Or—For her FINE EYES all the World ADMIRE her, yes, they have a Languiſhing caſt with 'em, ſhe is a little CIRCUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPECT, and has the advantage, that ſhe can throw one of 'em on her LOVER, and the other on her HUSBAND, at the ſame time, without altering her PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STURE, and look equally amorouſly on both. Well, but haſtn't Madam <hi>A</hi>—a very graceful preſence? Yes, and a fine ROL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LING-PIN-FACE. She's tall, as a BELL-ROPE, Lovely WHITE TEETH, and a mouth like an—O YES! CURI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUS HAIR, with an Eye of GOLD in't. Round plump SNOWY HANDS, and you ſee ſhe's not a little PROUD of SHOWING 'em. Charming EYE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BROWS, why you may ſee the LEAD SHINE upon 'em. A GOOD FOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUNE, Thoſe always come SHORT on the telling, or weigh leſs after Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Of an UNSPOTTED REPU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TATION,—

               <p>As touching the <hi>Accuſation</hi> of our ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly angry <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> who chargeth all our <hi>Sex</hi> with <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vanity,</hi> we may bear it with the leſs <hi>Concernment,</hi> becauſe almoſt in the <hi>Prelude</hi> thereof, he fairly owns what I take to be very much to our <hi>Advantage;</hi> namely, that it is not for <hi>the ſake of their Sex,</hi> that we take ſo much
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41990:16"/>
                  <hi>pains</hi> in <hi>Dreſſing</hi> and <hi>Adorning</hi> our ſelves, but meerly, and only for the <hi>Decency</hi> of the thing in its own <hi>Nature:</hi> I hope he will not <hi>forbid</hi> us to <hi>reverence</hi> our <hi>ſelves,</hi> or to conſider that we are <hi>humane Creatures.</hi> If we were to be <hi>buried,</hi> he would permit us to make uſe of ſome <hi>Ornaments,</hi> which yet ſurely he will not alſo attribute unto <hi>Vanity,</hi> ſeeing we ſhall have none but <hi>Worms</hi> to admire us in the <hi>Sepulchre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us therefore make the beſt uſe of this one piece of <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> which has, it ſeems, <hi>undeſignedly dropt</hi> from him. Let us record it againſt we have <hi>occaſion</hi> for it: This Gentleman plainly aſſerts in the midſt of all his paſſion, That <hi>it is not for the ſake of our Lovers that we take ſo much pains with our ſelves;</hi> nay, as if he had not bin yet <hi>kind</hi> enough, he again adds, that <hi>he himſelf will clear us from this Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I do not <hi>conceive</hi> that we need all that which he ſo bountifully <hi>grants</hi> us; for let us ſuppoſe that we did really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſomething more of <hi>Solicitude</hi> in our <hi>Dreſs,</hi> when we expected the <hi>Viſits</hi> of a <hi>Perſon,</hi> for whom we had a <hi>vertuous friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> I cannot ſee any thing <hi>criminal</hi> in ſuch a <hi>Behaviour,</hi> or, that looks like <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vanity;</hi> nay, rather the contrary, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>ſavours</hi> more of <hi>Pride</hi> than to <hi>affront</hi> or <hi>ſlight</hi> a Perſon, who doth not <hi>merit</hi> it, and who be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41990:16"/>upon us, in order to <hi>expreſs</hi> the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now, nothing in my Opinion can be a greater <hi>Affront</hi> to a Perſon of <hi>Condition,</hi> than when we are <hi>forewarn'd</hi> of their <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits,</hi> to be ſurpriz'd in a <hi>Dreſs</hi> not ſuitable to <hi>receive</hi> them;— Or, ſometimes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay the <hi>Honour</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Viſit</hi> in the ſame <hi>undecent Manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, it is evident, that many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons expreſs as much <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vanity</hi> in a <hi>moroſe</hi> and <hi>undecent Dreſs,</hi> and <hi>Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as any others can in the moſt <hi>faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Dreſs,</hi> and the <hi>moſt coſtly Ornaments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was not the <hi>Cynical Philoſopher, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> guilty of more unexcuſable <hi>Pride,</hi> than the famous <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> who came to make him a <hi>Viſit,</hi> for which the <hi>brutiſh</hi> Fellow could find no handſomer way of Requital than by bidding him <hi>ſtand out of his Sunſhine?</hi> We are not to regard what any Perſon <hi>wears,</hi> but in what <hi>manner</hi> he doth it. The moſt reſplendent Monarch in the Univerſe could not be more <hi>proud</hi> of his ſtately <hi>Palace,</hi> than that ſame <hi>Tatterdemalion</hi> was of his <hi>ſtinking Tub;</hi> nor the moſt Beautiful and moſt Magnificent <hi>Youth</hi> in all <hi>Greece,</hi> of his <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Splendid Robes,</hi> than he of his <hi>Squalid Rags,</hi> which would <hi>Nauſeate</hi> to <hi>behold</hi> them.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being agreed to, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe none will deny them, I proceed yet further in the <hi>Defence</hi> of our <hi>Sex,</hi> as to the <hi>Articles</hi> now under <hi>Debate;</hi> which I may
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41990:17"/>fairly do, or at leaſt <hi>ſilence</hi> our <hi>Accuſers,</hi> by a juſt <hi>Recrimination.</hi> If we are <hi>vain,</hi> are they otherwiſe?

And as Figure; ſo Form (by which I mean Colour) depends upon the cuſtomary Draughts of Nature. And we count a mixture of White and Red Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, becauſe it has Anciently been count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo; Whereas the <hi>Blacks</hi> (they ſay) have ether and contrary Notions of Beauty. A plain Demonſtration that Beauty is ſounded in Cuſtome, not Nature, and that nothing is originally and ſimply ugly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as the Form and I aſhion of the Body, ſo the Form and Faſhion of thoſe Garments that cover it, are all Judg'd handſome or ugly, by the Rules that Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem have proſcrib'd to it: For there be two ends of Cloaths; The firſt <hi>Natural,</hi> to defend the <hi>Body</hi> from <hi>Cold,</hi> &amp;c. The other <hi>Civil,</hi> to <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> Sexes, and the ſeveral degrees of each Sex, and to ſet it off and adorn it. And tho in the firſt of theſe a certain Fitneſs and Proportion of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to that Member it is deſign'd, or to the whole Body for the uſe aforeſaid, is the probable Rule it ought to be made by; yet in thoſe that diſtinguiſh the Sexes, and degrees of each Sex, (as ſome always muſt be own'd to have the only Authority). And
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41990:20"/>this is the Reaſon that ſeveral Faſhions that appear at firſt ſight ſtrange, if not Monſtrous, ſhall become ſo agreeable by Cnſtome that we fall in Love with 'em, and admire 'em, and cannot think thoſe we doted on before tollerable: 'Tis true, great Perſons having always claim'd the Richeſt works of the Richeſt Materials; ſuch habits have been uſual ſigns that they were known by. And wrought Gold and Garments of diverſe Colours, are the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Indications of Perſons of Honour, Greatneſs and Riches. And meaner Stuff and Workmanſhip for the Inferior ſort. Thus it has ever been. But we ſpeak not of the Materials, but Figure of the Diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Garment, and therefore for thoſe of Ornament, which is the laſt end of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I muſt lay down theſe General Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That as every Creature is bound by the Law of Nature, to build up and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair his Body by Nutritions, ſo to adorn it and ſet it off in the beſt manner he can, by the Ornaments neceſſary thereunto; which is in effect, but to ſet off Gods work, and make it appear more Illuſtrious and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The particular way to do this is not fixt, but guided by Fancy. That is, we firſt try one way and then another, according to our ſeveral Fancies and Opinions. And having experienc'd one way, perhaps in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41990:20"/>time we like it not, and fall to another, and ſo to a Third, and ſo on till perhaps we fall into ſome of the Old again, when either they are forgotten, or our Fancy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and we think it again conduceable to that end: And ſo, tho' we differ from our ſelves, in the Methods and Means of Adorning our Bodies, yet we agree in the end. The Means are only Trials, wherein we are guided by our Fancy. They are <hi>Eſſays</hi> of <hi>poor imperfect Man,</hi> to compleat himſelf, which is the end of <hi>Human Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We have an Eſtimation for Things we have not try'd, and for Perſons of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and true Worth, and the firſt is the occaſion of the <hi>Inventors of new Faſhions,</hi> and the ſecond, of thoſe <hi>that follow 'em.</hi> Every one wou'd improve his Body, and make it appear as perfect as he cou'd; but every one cannot tell how. The Rich and Great are thoſe that contrive theſe outward Embelliſhments; which having try'd and prov'd, others (that have a great Veneration for what they do) imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate 'em: So that there is cauſe in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Viz.</hi> Perfection, for the Invention of <hi>new Faſhions,</hi> and for the <hi>Vulgars</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em. As likewiſe for their Change; when we find by Experience that we have miſt this end, and therefore are enclin'd to try another,</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:41990:21"/>
               <p>And <hi>laſtly,</hi> When a <hi>Dreſs</hi> is grown com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or us'd by vile and ordinary Perſons, it has loſt its Diſtinguiſhing and Adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Quality; and ſo the End being loſt, 'tis fit it ſhould be laid aſide, and another aſſum'd, till Authority ſhall be pleaſed to Appropriate Garments and Faſhions to the ſeveral Sorts and Degrees of <hi>Sexes:</hi> So that 'tis the want of ſuch a good Law, that brings a neceſſity of Change of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions. 'Tis neceſſary Perſons of Quality ſhou'd be known, that they might have their due Honour: And ſeeing every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. Creature will break in upon a Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and dreſs like 'em, and Authority will not interpoſe to make an Incloſure, what can, nay, what ſhou'd they do but fall into another Mode for diſtinction? So that the Original of Faſhions, and the Changes thereof, is founded partly in our naturaldeſire of Perfection, and Attempts towards it, and partly in that Order and Diſtinction, which ſhou'd be amongſt Mankind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, all things will fall into Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being premis'd and agreed to (as I ſuppoſe they muſt be) I wonder why Man (unreaſonable Man, that is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſame Crime, if it be one) ſhou'd rally upon poor Ladies for the pretended Extravagancies of their Dreſſes. Do they pretend they are uggly or monſtruous? Why! there is nothing ſo in its ſelf; and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41990:21"/>Cuſtom reconciles every thing, and is the Rule of Decency; that is decent, which the tried and approv'd Cuſtoms of well-educated Perſons have made ſo.—is it becauſe they change and alter? Why! this is nothing but a continued Eſſay, to render themſelves Beautiful and Compleat in Body, as well as Mind; the Work of Humane Nature. We are ſent hither to Adorn and perfect both the Body and Mind, as far as we may. Education and Study is the Means to the one, and Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the other.</p>
               <p>Each are to be dreſs'd, tho' in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent way. The Body muſt be adorn'd with ſuch Improvements as it is capable of; and he that doth neglect it, is a Slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and a Sinner againſt the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I do not here make any Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon betwixt the Body and the Mind; I am willing to prefer the laſt, and its Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, (and wou'd to God it was more minded) yet I ſay alſo, that whilſt theſe are done, the other ought not to be left undone. Let the Lady be as long as ſhe will in her Cloſet, at her <hi>Dreſſing-Box,</hi> provided ſhe be not longer there than at her <hi>Prayers.</hi> I will not blame her Endeavours, to adorn her <hi>Body,</hi> if it doth not take up the neceſſary time of Adorning the <hi>Mind.</hi> Why! doth not every thing ſtrive at Perfection; and if it fails in one Attempt, try another? Do we not every day
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41990:22"/>
                  <hi>Eat</hi> and <hi>Drink,</hi> tho' we have try'd it ſo often, and have found it will cure the Diſeaſe call'd <hi>Hunger,</hi> for ſome time only? Is it a <hi>Sin,</hi> to render God's Workmanſhip <hi>beautiful,</hi> and try every <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> to effect it? To leave the <hi>Dreſſes</hi> as well as <hi>Company</hi> of the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> and to lay aſide a <hi>Garment</hi> when it can diſtinguiſh us no longer? <hi>Ladies</hi> wou'd keep to their <hi>Faſhions,</hi> if others wou'd keep <hi>from</hi> them: But the <hi>Inferior ſort</hi> break in upon 'em: What hurt is it then to forſake the <hi>Room?</hi> If <hi>Authority</hi> will not keep up <hi>Decorum,</hi> but render all <hi>common;</hi> yet let <hi>Ladies</hi> be more <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>regular:</hi> And tho' hard-hearted Mankind will not afford their <hi>Honour</hi> a <hi>Protection;</hi> yet I hope the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will do themſelves Juſtice.</p>
               <p>The Sum of all is this— God makes, and Apparel Shapes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—Every <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> is born in a poor <hi>Squalid</hi> Condition, and <hi>Imperfect</hi> in <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>figure,</hi> till by <hi>Nutrition</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> has attain'd its due <hi>Proportion, Magnitude,</hi> and <hi>Beauty;</hi> and even then it is ſo mean a <hi>Figure,</hi> that it is not fit to be ſeen <hi>Naked,</hi> nor can it <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh</hi> the ſeveral <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> and therefore <hi>Nature</hi> has taught all <hi>Nations</hi> to conceal their <hi>Imperfections</hi> under <hi>Cloaths,</hi> and to <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> one from another by them. And becauſe <hi>Beauty</hi> is the <hi>Creature</hi> of Fancy, and that the ordinary ſort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually <hi>break</hi> in upon the diſtinguiſhing

                  <p>You ſay, there's <hi>nothing ugly or beautiful in it ſelf, but with reſpect to the ordinary Rules and cuſtoms of Nations:</hi> Here Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, in the firſt place you ſeem <hi>not</hi> to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue clearly, but to confound <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Beauty,</hi> and <hi>Deformity,</hi> which ſeem to be widely <hi>different,</hi> at leaſt I'm ſure we form <hi>Notions</hi> ſufficiently <hi>diſtinct</hi> about 'em.

                  <p>I confeſs I always thought, <hi>Divinity and Topknots had but little to do with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that 'twas ſcarce decent to intereſt any thing ſo grave in ſo frivolous a Matter.</hi> I ſhall therefore leave you in full <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of 'em, and only admire at the Happineſs, <hi>a Woman of Learning,</hi> I ſee enjoys above all of <hi>her Sex</hi> or <hi>ours,</hi> that ſhe converſes with none ſuch as are <hi>vain</hi> enough to be pleaſed with <hi>fine Cloaths,</hi> ot think better of themſelves, when dreſs'd with the <hi>utmoſt Curioſity,</hi> (tho' that, as ſhe has, <hi>the very
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41990:33"/>PERFECTION of H<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MANE NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>T<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE,</hi>) than when <hi>Mobb'd</hi> up in their <hi>Night-cloaths,</hi> when they expect no <hi>Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> nor <hi>Admirers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here will come in very fitly <hi>your three Conditions, which make it lawful;</hi> you think to wear the <hi>fineſt Cloaths</hi> you can get: Firſt, <hi>that they be honeſtly come by,</hi> which I confeſs is prudently enough put in; becauſe <hi>lifting</hi> 'em out of a <hi>Shop,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>paying</hi> for 'em, is ſomething <hi>dangerous,</hi> as well as <hi>ſcandalous.</hi> The ſecond, that they be <hi>ſuitable to our Condition;</hi> that is, according to your Rules, frequently <hi>change,</hi> if of <hi>Quality;</hi> and if <hi>lower, Imitations</hi> of thoſe <hi>Changes.</hi> Thirdly, That <hi>your Sex been't proud of 'em, nor fooliſhly think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the better for 'em,</hi>—which you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſatisfied us they never do. And laſtly, <hi>that they be willing to part with 'em on the account of Neceſſity, Juſtice or Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>— Which when they are, I dare promiſe 'em, others in their room, more Magnificent than were ever worn by an <hi>Empreſs;</hi> eſpecially, when their Charity is ſo ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant, to give away one of their Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Dreſſes, or to part with 'em, or deny themſelves of 'em, to Relieve the Pooreſt and moſt Miſerable Creature in Nature.</p>
                  <p>If you know any ſuch, you'd do your <hi>Sex</hi> a great Kindneſs, to inſtance in 'em. I deſire but Twenty in Twenty Years, and give you all <hi>England</hi> to find 'em.</p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:41990:34"/>
                  <p>But you yet plead that your Inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Change of <hi>Faſhions,</hi> encourages <hi>Ingenuity</hi> and <hi>Induſtry,</hi> and <hi>Trade,</hi> and all that's Good. A home Argument, it muſt be own'd, for it abundantly laps over, as will plainly appear by the Conſequence; for if whatever encourag'd any Art or Trade were defenſible for that Reaſon, it muſt be granted, that Quarrels and Injuſtice it ſelf are very defenſible, becauſe without them the Lawyer cou'd not get his Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. That Debauchery, Intemperance, Lewdneſs, are very pretty Qualifications, becauſe the poor Vintners, and Phyſitians and Surgeons (to go no further) get ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry comfortable Livelihoods on theſe Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and it's likely, wou'd ſtarve with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out 'em.</p>
                  <p>But above all, who wou'd not admire at your Ladyſhip, for bearing us in Hand, That a great deal of good <hi>Charity</hi> comes from this Variety of <hi>Dreſſes,</hi> becauſe the <hi>ladies</hi> give away their <hi>Cloaths</hi> to their <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants.</hi> A ſuperabundant piece of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, to beſtow an old Gown on an old Chamber-Maid! And is this to ballance the loſs of our ancient <hi>Engliſh Hoſpitality,</hi> which you own is ſo much decay'd, and that it owes its Ruin in a great part to the Extravagance of your <hi>Sex,</hi> you hardly your ſelf ingenuouſly deny, ſince this draws all the <hi>Ladies</hi> to Town, and you, their Husbands, letting the Seats of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41990:34"/>drop to the Ground, for fear you ſhou'd have the <hi>new Faſhions</hi> a Fortnight too late, if you went not up to meet 'em.</p>
                  <p>And beſides, this wonderful <hi>Charity</hi> of you <hi>Ladies,</hi> in beſtowing your Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robes thus plentifully on your Inferiors, which by the way your Husband is ſure to pay for, and making, as you call it, <hi>a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of Cloaths,</hi> unluckily deſtroys one of the other <hi>Ends,</hi> already mention'd, and that is, encouraging <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Induſtry:</hi> For the more of your old Cloaths there are in <hi>Long-Lane,</hi> the fewer new ones muſt conſequently be made. No, Madam, the true way to be charitable indeed to thoſe poor Tradeſmen, were to deal with your <hi>Cloaths,</hi> as they ſay the <hi>Dutch</hi> do with their <hi>Cinnamon,</hi> and other <hi>Spices;</hi> when they have a great Harveſt of 'em in the <hi>Eaſtern Countreys,</hi> make a huge Bonfire of a great part of 'em, which effectually prevents a Glut in <hi>Europe,</hi> and gets 'em a better Trade for the Remainder,</p>
                  <p>And now for the Strenuous Defence of your <hi>Monumental Head-Dreſſes,</hi> both in <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> which it ſeems muſt not be Condemn'd, tho' you fairly own they have ſeeded to that Extravagant Heighth, that we are forc'd to alter our Coaches and Houſes, to make you room (as the <hi>Trojans</hi> pull'd down their own Walls to give the <hi>fatal Horſe</hi> Admittance.—But
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41990:35"/>once more, theſe <hi>very</hi> Alterations employ ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor People, and keep 'em from ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.— An extraordinary Advantage, juſt as a Bullies breaking Windows, makes Work for the <hi>Glazier,</hi> tho' the Landlord will hardly thank him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But they wear 'em ſo high, becauſe they would ſeem proper, and is there any hurt in that?</q> — Nay, I confeſs there's only Pride and Diſcontent, and a little aukard Hypocriſie in't, as well as open Folly; for the Wench that dances up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Stilts, or <hi>Jack-Pudding,</hi> that ſtalks with 'em from one Booth to another, may more properly be therefore accounted <hi>Tall,</hi> than one, who wears <hi>high Toppings</hi> for that Reaſon. Beſides, that's only an Excuſe for the <hi>Short;</hi> but what's this to thoſe who are already high enough, and by this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition are made a <hi>Match for a Garagantua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The moſt plauſible thing that you can urge for 'em, is towards the Cloſe, that They ſave time, which your Sex improve to better Uſes. This I confeſs is a good Defence, if 'twere but a true one: For is't not evident, that your Sexes time lies dead upon your Hands, and you know not what to do with 't; and if you are Doing nothing, you'll ſoon be doing Miſchief; and on the other ſide, imploying your ſelves in what you are capable of, Dreſſing and Trifling, is at leaſt a more Tolerable ſort of Idleneſs.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:41990:35"/>
                  <p>I had like to have overſlipt one thing before we part, which well deſerves No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. You ſay that the Obſtinacy of your Sex in this ſort of Dreſs is a ſign, That you can once be conſtant. I muſt grant it is ſo, but then pray anſwer me when you ever were ſo before, unleſs when in the wrong? — And if theſe odd, inconvenient, unbecoming, fantaſtical <hi>Windmill-Heads,</hi> are not ſufficient Evidence, that you're ſo in the preſent Caſe; then I'll ſay no more, but that I am</p>

Formerly in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forgotten days of <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi> to have a good <hi>Hand at Bluſhing,</hi> went as far to the marrying a young Girl as a <hi>good Portion.</hi> It lookt like a Red Flag of <hi>Defiance,</hi> hung out, which makes a Man of Courage more eager for the <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet.</hi> It appear'd wholſome at once, and pleaſing; 'twas ſo like an <hi>Apple</hi> next the <hi>Sun,</hi> or a fine <hi>Streaky Katherine Pear,</hi> that every Body's Mouth <hi>water'd</hi> at it. It look'd like a lovely <hi>Sun-ſhiny Evening,</hi> or any of the fine things, to which an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous <hi>Poet</hi> compares his <hi>Miſtreſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thoſe Days are gon—We are now come to an Age of much more <hi>ſinful Knowledge. Your Sex,</hi> even <hi>yours,</hi> is improv'd in <hi>Deceit,</hi> and ours in <hi>Caution.</hi> And when we ſee a young Thing hanging down her Head, and her Face cover'd with <hi>Bluſhes,</hi> how are we <hi>uncharitable</hi> when we think there's
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41990:36"/>ſome reaſon for't? You were therefore as good leave this Trick; which, like all others, now 'tis found out, can be no longer uſeful, and which has not the leaſt Shadow of Reaſon to be ſo highly eſteem'd, both by your <hi>Sex,</hi> and ours, as it has bin formerly. For when you <hi>Bluſh,</hi> either you have done ſomewhat, for which you ought to be aſham'd, or you have not: If the latter, as you ſay, it often happens, why d'ye <hi>Bluſh</hi> at all? If the former, how come you ſo ill <hi>Diſſemblers,</hi> to confeſs it,—and what are you the better for't? or what Satisfaction is't for an <hi>Ill Action?</hi> Or if for ſome little innocent Miſtake, or Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, you have ſtill leſs Reaſon.</p>
               <p>A <hi>modeſt Aſſurance</hi> is after all, the beſt Token of <hi>Innocence;</hi> but as for <hi>Bluſhing,</hi> the <hi>Players</hi> themſelves can do it; and thoſe who have yet a leſs <hi>honeſt Name,</hi> in the greateſt Perfection.</p>

               </byline>
               <p>YOU were beſt blame <hi>Nature,</hi> who has both given us <hi>Faces,</hi> ſuch as they are, and <hi>Blood,</hi> to ariſe in 'em, and <hi>Veins</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey it thither; a in other Springs and Fountains, which ſhe ſends up from her inexhauſted Store, and yet you will hardly complain of her for refreſhing the World. I confeſs I know not what to make of <hi>Bluſhing,</hi> but yet I wou'd not be without it; for 'tis, I think, a handſome ſilent Reproof t'ye, when your <hi>Sex</hi> ſpeaks ſuch things as are not fit for ours to hear; and if we <hi>bluſh</hi> for you, who have forgot to do't for your ſelves, ſure you ought not to be ſo highly diſpleaſed at it.</p>
               <p>'Tis well you own that <hi>Bluſhing</hi> was once reckon'd a good Sign, in the Days, you ſay, of <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Innocence,</hi> and 'twill be hard for you to ſhow a Reaſon why it ſhou'd now be diſus'd, unleſs becauſe your <hi>Sex</hi> has driven thoſe her two Companions out of the World.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Bluſh</hi> is the Daughter of <hi>Modeſty,</hi> and no wonder you are ſo ready to quarrel with her, when you have ſo long ſince proclaim'd <hi>open War</hi> againſt the <hi>Mother.</hi> What
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41990:37"/>is more ingenuous than this <hi>Emotion</hi> in the Young and Innocent, and who is there that's not pleaſed to ſee it?</p>
               <p>'Tis a ſort of a <hi>Natural Virtue,</hi> and an <hi>Indication</hi> how good we ſhould all be, wou'd but you let us alone. Shamefacedneſs is the firſt and laſt Guard of <hi>Innocence,</hi> which well may be ſuppoſed to bleed at the ſight of her Murtherers.</p>
               <p>Sometimes you pretend there's nothing in't commendable, becauſe 'tis not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, but that's eaſily anſwer'd, for that the Habit of <hi>Modeſty,</hi> whence it flows, may be eaſily loſt, your <hi>Sex</hi> can furniſh us with nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Examples.</p>
               <p>But he muſt be very much in Love with <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> who ſhall pretend to prove that the Act of <hi>Bluſhing</hi> is in our own power, ſo that any one can <hi>Bluſh</hi> when they pleaſe, which you may perſwade the World is true, when you can but ſo much as ſneeze in that manner, without uſing any thing to provoke it.</p>
               <p>You ſay many <hi>Bluſh,</hi> who have no <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty.</hi> I can't tell that, but am rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to believe they have ſtill ſome Sparks on't left, and much more than thoſe that <hi>ſpeak âgainſt</hi> it, wherein they contradict the Sentiments of all places, and all Ages, as well as common Experience, Senſe and Reaſon.</p>

               <p>Well, after all this <hi>Chatt,</hi> which has laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 2 or 3 Scenes, up goes the <hi>Curtain,</hi> and a very <hi>Sycorax</hi> ſtares us in the Face, ſo Frightful perhaps and Ghaſtly, that if <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth's</hi> a Playing, we are teady to take you for one of the <hi>Witches,</hi> vaniſh'd from the <hi>Stage</hi> into the <hi>Pit</hi> or <hi>Gallerys,</hi> then we <hi>Nauſeate</hi> all our own compliments, ſtart at the thoughts of a <hi>Succubus,</hi> and wou'd not ſtay a moment longer with you, tho like one of the <hi>wayward Siſters</hi> before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, you would give us a <hi>Kingdom</hi> for our <hi>reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet what honeſt meaning can you have by thus <hi>putting</hi> out the <hi>Lights?</hi> Some <hi>dark work</hi> ſure you have a mind to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in, and by this ſtratagem you can defy <hi>Day</hi> it ſelf, and make it <hi>Night</hi> whenever you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>They talk of <hi>Witches</hi> calling the <hi>Moon</hi> out of <hi>Heaven,</hi> but you have found a way to <hi>call</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> thence, or which is the ſame thing, make it <hi>ſhine</hi> in vain, and never <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> your <hi>crimes,</hi> or hinder your <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truth,</hi> indeed, ſeeks the <hi>Light,</hi> and hates all <hi>Diſguiſes,</hi> but what's that to <hi>Women,</hi> who are never more <hi>like</hi> themſelves, then

               </p>
               <p>And now we talk of <hi>Truth,</hi> I wonder how the old doating <hi>Moraliſts,</hi> came to make that, and all the other <hi>Virtues</hi> of the <hi>Feminine Gender.

               </p>
               <p>But I think, they reckon the ſeven <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sins</hi> too of the ſame Gender, and in that I confeſs, they have made ſome <hi>amends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there's hardly any of 'em that your <hi>Mask</hi> wou'd not fit, for what ſome of your Flatterers have ſaid of ſome of your <hi>Sex,</hi> that if <hi>virtue</hi> were to take a <hi>viſible ſhape,</hi> 'twou'd certainly appear in <hi>theirs,</hi> may with more Juſtice and Reaſon be ſaid of <hi>Vice,</hi> at leaſt as to a great part of you, who when once you give your minds to 't, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <hi>exceed Mankind,</hi> and are more <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you wear not this <hi>Velvet ſcurf</hi> for nothing. No, 'tis that the Amorous <hi>Sun</hi> mayn't look upon you; nor the <hi>wind kiſs</hi> you ſo cloſe till it Chap your pretty Lips;

               <byline>By Sir <hi>THOMAS—</hi>
               </byline>
               <p>WHich will appear beyond Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by an Induction of Particulars. You are evidently more cruel to <hi>Enemies,</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:41990:42"/>and even to Friends: To your <hi>Rivals,</hi> and your <hi>lovers,</hi> and your very own dear ſelves, which wou'd make one leſs wonder at your Barbarity to all the reſt.</p>
               <p>And firſt for your <hi>Enemies,</hi> whom if you conquer'd by Right of <hi>War,</hi> and only made uſe of the Advantages which <hi>Fortune</hi> gave you, as did your ſtrapping <hi>Amazonian Predeceſſors,</hi> when they rambled about the World, and carry'd Slaughter &amp; Deſtruction with 'em where ever they came; this wou'd be ſomewhat more excuſable: But a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward no more dares be Brave, than Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, nor is therefore likely to Attack open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one he hates. You have more Sure and Private Methods of Deſtruction: You out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do the very <hi>Crocodile,</hi> who is ſaid to weep over her Prey; for you kill <hi>ſmiling,</hi> and deſtroy <hi>embracing,</hi> like the <hi>Tyrant</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as he call'd her; who had an Engine dreſs'd up like a Beautiful Woman, to whom he led thoſe he had a mind to be rid of, who advancing to Salute her, ſhe immediately cloſed her Arms, and Cruſh'd 'em to Death.</p>
               <p>'Tis a common Obſervation, that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hear of any remarkable Miſchief, rarely of any Bloody Murther, but there's a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at one end on't; and that you exceed the moſt Barbarous Thieves and Banditti in Thirſt of Blood, thoſe poor Travellers feel, who fall into the Hands of ſuch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they have any of your <hi>Sex</hi> among
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41990:42"/>them. You have all a Touch of the <hi>Wild-Iriſh</hi> in ye. You do ten times more Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief than the <hi>Men;</hi> and if Candles are to be made of <hi>Heretical Tallow,</hi> or a <hi>Sprawling Child</hi> or two to be roaſted, who but a Woman to dip her Hands in the Greaſe of one, and Spit and Baſte the other?</p>
               <p>And if you can do this in Cold Blood, and from an Innate Love to Cruelty, with little or no Provocation, what is the Viper then when his Spirits are enrag'd? What a Figure d'ye make when poſſeſs'd with your own proper Spirit (for you need no worſe) that I mean of <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Revenge?</hi> How amiable do you all look when you're an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry? How ſweetly are all your <hi>Muſeles</hi> turn'd? How mild your Eyes? How ſoft your Voice, and how like <hi>Incarnate Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> all over?</p>
               <p>The Worm turns a Serpent, and that a Dragon; you breathe as many Knives as a Juggler ever ſwallow'd; you von<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>This in ordinary Caſes, but if you are once wrought to the heighth, if your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41990:43"/>expoſed, you are then a thouſand times worſe than I've yet deſcrib'd; more Neſts of Hells and Furies ſwarm within you; you are more Venemouſly, more rancorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implacable; all Blaſting, Lightning, and Hurricane. In ſhort, ſo ſuperlatively bad, that none but you your ſelves can Conceive or Deſcribe it.</p>
               <p>Tho' after all, I think, you are leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous when you appear thus in your own proper Shapes, than when diſguis'd, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt paſt Knowledge, in thoſe of Love and Friendſhip: For then you perfectly drill us to Death, and murther us, as they ſay Witches do, by turning us into Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſhions, and ſticking us all over with Nails and Bodkins, like an Orange with Cloves, or <hi>Bergerac</hi> with his Flies, to give us the more lingring Torments.</p>
               <p>Or elſe, to return to <hi>Witches</hi> agen, when you have once Metamorphoſed a Man into that <hi>Brute</hi> of a Lover, you ſtrait clap a Broom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff behind him, and ſwitch him thro'thick &amp; thin in all your <hi>Aerial Journeys,</hi> which way ſoever the <hi>Vane</hi> happens to turn, the <hi>unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Jaunts,</hi> and endleſs <hi>wild Gooſe Chaſes</hi> of your own <hi>Jack-a-Lent Fancies,</hi> and <hi>unaccountable Humours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A famous Doctor is of Opinion, that Spirits, tho' ſeparate, have yet a Plaſtic Power over <hi>Matter,</hi> and can <hi>mould</hi> a <hi>Body</hi> into whatſoever Form or Shape they pleaſe, as we can a bit of Wax: For Example—A
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41990:43"/>
                  <hi>Man</hi> into a Pudding,—a <hi>Woman</hi> into a Snake or Cat, or any other Miſchievous Creature. An old Man, and a Child into a Cockle, or an Oyſter; which laſt may the more eaſily be brought about, if that will but hold, which is very poſitively aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by another <hi>Grave Philoſopher,</hi> that their Souls are the ſame already, or that he can hardly imagin any <hi>Difference</hi> between 'em. But whether or no one word of this be true, 'tis ſure enough, you make us what you pleaſe, and moſt maliciouſly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the very Form and Figure of many a poor <hi>Lover;</hi> ſometimes you draw out his Neck, till by Virtue of a looſning Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Hemp, 'tis as long as the Glutton wiſh'd his own: But much oftner his Ears to that prodigious length, that <hi>Midas</hi> was a meer <hi>Roundhead</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>At one time you skrew his Face into a thouſand <hi>Antic Forms,</hi> at another his whole Body, which looks Aſquint af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you have once overlook'd him, as much as thoſe Eyes which did it. His Chap falls, he hears with his Mouth, and only eats with his Eyes; his Hands dangle, if they don't happen to fall croſs one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and in a word, you ſteal him away from himſelf, and leave a perfect Chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in his Room; and if there can be a higher or baſer Inſtance of barbarous Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, than not only to do this, but to <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph</hi> in it; and when you have adorn'd
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41990:44"/>your <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Anti-chambers</hi> with ſuch Brutes of your own transforming, as <hi>Circes</hi> Palace was ſtock'd with, to divert your ſelf, with ſetting the poor <hi>Creatures</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the ears, to tear one anothers Hearts out. I ſay, if you can ſhow me any thing more brutally cruel than this, which is your conſtant Practice; why, then I muſt own your <hi>Sex</hi> has one Reſerve of Miſchief, wherewith I was never yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.</p>
               <p>But it's in vain for Man to expect bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Quarter,</hi> when your own <hi>Sex,</hi> if any thing handſome, are as implacably hated by you as old Age, or a fooliſh <hi>faithful Friend,</hi> that tells you all your Faults, in hopes to make you better. You wou'd all be <hi>Eleanors</hi> if you had <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſamonds</hi> to deal with, and what <hi>maze</hi> ſo intricate, that you have not a <hi>Model</hi> on't in your own Minds? Pulling <hi>Quoifs</hi> is nothing,—<q>Tear out the Jades Eyes; off with her Noſe (tho' war' <hi>Coventry;</hi>) ſtamp her under Feet; ſhe have my Man; ſhe ſeduce my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; ſhe pretend to be as handſome as me; I'll eat her Heart; I'll gnaw her Soul; I'll grind her till ſhe's inviſible.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, Your Cruelty is extended, even to your ſelves as dearly as you dote upon 'em: Never were there elſewhere any <hi>Cannibals</hi> ſo fierce, as to eat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and feed on their own Fleſh, tho' they perhaps might now and then
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41990:44"/>make a luſcious Feaſt on a fat Friend, or Enemy. <hi>Envy</hi> makes you gnaw your own Intrails, defeated <hi>Malice</hi> or <hi>Revenge</hi> ſets you oftentimes quarrelling with your ſelves, and wreaking your Spite on your own Minds or Bodies, becauſe you can't reach others: But <hi>Pride</hi> is the moſt <hi>vexatious Devil</hi> of all your Tormentors.</p>
               <p>To this you are <hi>half Martyrs;</hi> for this 'tis that you ſo often wear a <hi>Scotch Boot</hi> all over ye. The <hi>Thumbkin</hi>'s a Jeſt to't, and no more than a ſtrait pair of Gloves. You are ſo far from allowing your ſelves room to Eat, that you care not whether you can breathe or no, ſo you can but look fine, and have your admirable Shape com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.

               <p>The Man has generally none to <hi>govern</hi> him, or to adviſe him better, but you have

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41990:49"/>make any <hi>unprejudiced Perſon</hi> believe: which Party is it, pray, makes the firſt Onſet? 'Tis not the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of our <hi>Sex,</hi> howe're Inferior to yours, to become your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners. Is it not <hi>you</hi> Men that are always at pains of <hi>Courtſhip:</hi> And, if in a <hi>Criminal Amour,</hi> how many <hi>Sighs, Vows,</hi> and <hi>Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Submiſſions,</hi> muſt a Man be guilty of, before he can obtain the leaſt <hi>Favour?</hi> You ſay our <hi>Sex</hi> has the Reſtraints of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty</hi> and <hi>Reputation, &amp;c.</hi> which yours want: Really, we're oblig'd to'e, that you'll grant us ſo much, tho' I'm pretty well ſatisfy'd you'd rather we were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe Reſtraints, that you might have the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of Damning your Selves, and Ruining us at an eaſier Rate.

And what you ſay of us in this Caſe, may with good reaſon be be return'd upon you, ſhou'd any Friend be ſo kind to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you, the very Apprehenſion of ſuch a Reſtraint wou'd be ſufficient to make any Man Chuſe, and more eagerly purſue his <hi>Deſtruction.</hi> And that way at leaſt he would juſtifie his pretending to be <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Maſter</hi> of himſelf, by ſhewing that he dares be Damn'd, in ſpite of all Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either from <hi>Friends</hi> or <hi>Enemies.</hi>

For this you part with Sloth it ſelf; nay, <hi>your</hi> darling <hi>Pride</hi> can hardly Rival it; for you'll rather grow old for want of Sleep; nay, venture firing the Houſe, and bring your ſelf Spitchcockt in the middle on't, then leave off before you've done the Story.</p>

               <head>LETTER XI. <hi>Againſt</hi> Painting, <hi>and other</hi> Artificial Beauty.</head>
               <byline>By Sir <hi>WILLIAM —</hi>
               </byline>
               <p>WHat — are you not content with your <hi>Native Miſchiefs?</hi> Thoſe <hi>Poyſons</hi> that are born with you; your <hi>Eyes,</hi> your <hi>Voice,</hi> your <hi>Faces;</hi> but you muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding too to <hi>Art</hi> for our <hi>undoing,</hi> and attack us with <hi>Auxiliary Deſtructions?</hi> Where will your Malice end, and what can keep pace with it but your <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wou'd you give us once ſome Infallible Mark, to know you from your ſelves — I mean what parts of you are Real, and what Aſcititious, and Unnatural; for 'tis the oddeſt <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the World to bow down to the Excrements of a Worm, to adore <hi>Spaniſh VVool,</hi> and <hi>Chalk,</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What a high degree of Pride is it to find Fault with what Nature has made you, to mend the Work of the great <hi>Artificer?</hi> So Scandalous and Ill-ſounding a Practice, that I'd fain hope moſt <hi>Honeſt</hi> and <hi>Virtuous</hi> Women were now aſham'd on't.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:41990:63"/>
               <p>And yet tho' there's few of your <hi>Sex</hi> but find it neceſſary to pretend at leaſt to thoſe Characters, how many of 'em are there who lay it on as thick on their own Faces, as the old Painters did on the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of others; you wou'd think they made uſe of a Trowel inſtead of a Pencil, and make ſuch ſtrong Work, you were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as good touch a new-plaiſter'd Wall as one of their Faces.</p>
               <p>Either you are already as handſome as you think your ſelves, or as errand <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> as every Whoremaſter thinks his <hi>own VVife,</hi> or elſe indifferent;—a <hi>Layr</hi> of one with t'other, neither Foul enough to have the ſame Effect with <hi>Antimony,</hi> on touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, nor ſo wickedly Charming, as to drive your poor <hi>Vaſſals</hi> to <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;</hi> and in which ſoever of theſe Forms you'll rank your ſelves, I ſee no need of this <hi>Dawbing,</hi> nor what advantage you can propoſe by it.</p>
               <p>If ynu are handſome already, you may learn from all the <hi>Court Ladies</hi> who uſe it, that <hi>Painting</hi> is the readieſt way to make you <hi>Grandams</hi> before your times; you muſt expect to look old, at leaſt Twenty Years ſooner.</p>
               <p>'Tis like <hi>mending deep ways</hi> with <hi>Dirt,</hi> you muſt be perpetually laying on, Load after Load, or the <hi>unfaſhionable VVrinkles</hi> will devour all your <hi>Labour.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:41990:64"/>
               <p>You know your ſelves it poiſons the <hi>Skin,</hi> and ruins the <hi>Complexion,</hi> and yet you'll not be beat off on't, ſo fond you are of <hi>mending Nature,</hi> and of a <hi>Beauty</hi> that can endure neither Fire nor Air, Heat nor Rain, which laſts not ſo long as a Flower's; and which, as it ſoon withers it ſelf, ſo will wither you too when it leaves you.</p>
               <p>If you are Indifferent, be contented, and thank <hi>Nature,</hi> for neither having made you a Monſter of <hi>Deformity</hi> nor <hi>Beauty:</hi> For your <hi>Gigantick Beauty</hi> is certainly monſtrous in <hi>Execſs,</hi> as well as others in <hi>Defect,</hi> and like the poor Gyants in <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> muſt be ſure to be <hi>Mown</hi> o'rethwart, or <hi>Cleft</hi> downright,—ſooner than any in all the Army.—Since then you have already all you can reaſonably deſire, and are in a more <hi>happy Condition</hi> than either of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams; for what reaſon is't that you'd ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſuch an Alteration, as muſt by Turns ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ye to both the Oppoſite Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? You'll at firſt, it may be, think you look very Charming, which will <hi>loo</hi> all the real or ſuppoſed <hi>Beauties</hi> about your Ears, and "She <hi>Paints</hi>—is the Word of <hi>Battle,</hi> which they'll all whiſper round, tho' they have it on ſo thick themſelves, that their <hi>Faces</hi> are like to ſtick to one another.</p>
               <p>But after this <hi>aukard Flouriſh,</hi> which it may be, for a little while you may make by this <hi>Artificial Beauty,</hi> you at laſt find
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41990:64"/>your ſelf on the ſudden, tumbling into the loweſt <hi>Claſs</hi> of all,—that of <hi>Real Deformity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And well remember'd for poor <hi>Dowdy,</hi> who was in danger of being quite forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:—There ſhe ſits, tearing her Face, breaking her Glaſſes, ſhovelling it on, and rendring her ſelf a thouſand times more ghaſtly than when ſhe was firſt Cubb'd.— Like the poor <hi>VVench</hi> that came to a Country Painter on a <hi>Fair-day,</hi> reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be a little finer than Ordinary, and gave the Fellow a Shilling to <hi>Paint</hi> her, which the Rogue did with a Vengeance; making her a <hi>blue Noſe, black Lips, Green Cheeks, ſcarlet Eyebrows,</hi> and the reſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable; that when ſhe came abroad, ſhe ſcar'd all the <hi>Fair,</hi> as if one of the <hi>Tygars</hi> or <hi>Lyons</hi> had broke looſe amongſt 'em.</p>
               <p>And pray, <hi>Madam,</hi> why can't you be ſatisfy'd with all the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gglineſs</hi> you were born with? 'Twas a fair <hi>Portion.</hi> and one wou'd think you ſhou'd not be ſo <hi>over-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,</hi> to augment it.</p>
               <p>Nothing will ever go well that's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken in ſpite of <hi>Nature:</hi> The <hi>Beau</hi> may as well ſet up for a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> the <hi>Bully</hi> for a <hi>General,</hi> or your <hi>Holbourn-Heck</hi> for a <hi>Stateſman</hi> (or what's next door to't, an <hi>Alderman</hi>) as you be a <hi>Beauty,</hi> without asking <hi>Nature</hi> leave; and the more like you are without being one, <hi>you</hi> are ſtill the more deform'd. Thoſe <hi>Monkey Affectations</hi> will
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41990:65"/>render you ſtill more Ridiculous and Odious.</p>
               <p>Endeavour then to ſet your Mind ſtrait, which is in your own Power; make that <hi>well-complexion'd</hi> and <hi>beautiful,</hi> and thus render your ſelf deſirable and amiable, which you may obtain with more Certainty than if you had the <hi>fineſt Body</hi> in the World.</p>
               <p>For after all, Ladies, nothing is more demonſtrable than that 'tis not a <hi>fine Face</hi> only that either obtains Love, or preſerves it, which takes off your laſt Pretences for theſe <hi>Artificial Meliorations,</hi> as you call 'em, that you uſe 'em out of an honeſt Intent, to get good <hi>Husbands,</hi> or to hold faſt their Hearts, when you have 'em once in your Clutches: Nothing of that will cure a <hi>rambling Mind;</hi> the likelieſt way to do it is, by being <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which at leaſt will make you your ſelf more <hi>Eaſie</hi> and <hi>Happy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I forgot I had quarrell'd with your <hi>whole Sex,</hi> for which Reaſon you ought not to expect to have any of this good Advice from me: However, I imagin 'twill be much the ſame thing, and that you are more <hi>VVomen</hi> than to make any uſe on't.</p>

               </head>
               <byline>By Madam <hi>GODFREY—</hi>
               </byline>
               <p>YOur main Argument againſt our <hi>Sex</hi> in this particular proves <hi>too much,</hi> and therefore nothing at all: We cannot make uſe of a little innocent <hi>Art,</hi> in order to <hi>pleaſe</hi> and <hi>oblige</hi> you, and preſerve your <hi>fickle hearts,</hi> but you exclaim immediately that we are for <hi>quarrelling Nature;</hi> that we are guilty of intolerable <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vanity,</hi> and diſcontented with him that made us: And why do you not bring the ſame <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations</hi> againſt us, for wearing <hi>Cloaths,</hi> or ſuch <hi>Colours</hi> as we find moſt become us—as you your wigs according to your Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <hi>Deformity</hi> is not <hi>Nature,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently one that endeavours to hide her crookedneſs for Example, only ſtrives to conceal what is <hi>unnatural;</hi> to throw that behind the ſcenes which wou'd not ſo well bear a <hi>publick view.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nature</hi> it ſelf endeavours to <hi>hide</hi> whatever is undecent and unſeemly: If we do the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41990:66"/>ſame we only <hi>imitate</hi> her, and you cannot blame us for it without great <hi>Injuſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will perhaps ſay, what is all this to Painting and Dawbing our Faces, at which you are ſo highly diſpleas'd? Yes, it affects even that ſo much, that it takes off your greateſt objection againſt it, that it is mending the work of Nature, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly may be <hi>innocently attempted,</hi> or at leaſt rectifying her miſtakes; otherwiſe you could not <hi>Cut</hi> a <hi>Hair-Lip,</hi> or a <hi>Wen,</hi> that hinder'd the <hi>ſight,</hi> which you will hardly ſay is <hi>unlawful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whatever then the Inconveniences may be, in any ſuch Practices, they can hardly amount to any more then what may be fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd in many ſorts of <hi>Dreſſes,</hi> which may appear a little <hi>oddly</hi> at firſt, but uſe and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom reconciles 'em: And this is ſo evident, even of the point that is here moſt in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy</hi> between us, that in ſome <hi>Countreys</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> it is ſo far from being <hi>Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> that the <hi>Ladys</hi> let their <hi>Lovers</hi> hold their <hi>Glaſſes</hi> to 'em, while they are <hi>Painting</hi> themſelves, who eſteem it as a <hi>favour,</hi> and are no ways <hi>diſpleas'd</hi> at it.</p>
               <p>You are as <hi>angry,</hi> I perceive, with all kind of <hi>waſhes</hi> as you are with <hi>Painting</hi> it ſelf, and I muſt confeſs, with almoſt as much reaſon. For what is <hi>Paint</hi> but a little more <hi>ſubstantial waſh,</hi> which laſts ſomething <hi>lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> or is more <hi>viſible</hi> then the other?</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:41990:66"/>
               <p>But if you are againſt any of thoſe, if you are ſo <hi>Zealons</hi> againſt a little innocent <hi>Water,</hi> to clear the Face from <hi>Freckles,</hi> or any ſuch inconvenience, we may ſhortly expect you will forbid us <hi>Fountain-Water</hi> too, and we muſt not have leave to <hi>waſh</hi> in <hi>that,</hi> becauſe it looks like <hi>Pride,</hi> and being diſcontented with <hi>Nature.</hi> Nay, we may carry it yet higher, for all know ſome ſort of <hi>Water,</hi> as 'tis ſimply taken from the <hi>Well,</hi> will add a <hi>florid Colour</hi> to the Face, and both increaſe and preſerve the Beauty: But will you like wiſe abridge us of ſuch as theſe, or are you reſolv'd to deny us, the moſt common <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of <hi>Nature?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You dare not ſay it is <hi>unlawful</hi> to remove any thing, even from the Face it ſelf which renders it <hi>deform'd,</hi> or <hi>unpleaſing</hi> to the Spectators: If you <hi>thought</hi> ſo, you would ſcarce practice quite contrary to your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: It is plain, that nature deſign'd Man a <hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Awful</hi> Creature: It gave you <hi>Beards</hi> to ſtrike us with <hi>Reverence:</hi> Why then do you <hi>envy</hi> your ſelves ſuch an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage?</hi> What mean all theſe <hi>Waſhballs,</hi> and <hi>Tweezers,</hi> and <hi>Razors,</hi> and <hi>Depilatories</hi> which you uſe once or twice a <hi>week,</hi> and all that you may look like <hi>women,</hi> whom you ſo much deſpiſe?</p>
               <p>But what is yet much more <hi>inexcuſable,</hi> you have many of you now Learnt to patch, nay to Paint as well as we. If you had as <hi>Lawful</hi> an Excuſe for this as the <hi>Women,</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:41990:67"/>and did uſe theſe <hi>Arts</hi> meerly to pleaſe your Wives, as we do to oblige our Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, none could juſtly blame you: But we have reaſon to fear there is ſomething worſe at the bottom: It is not for nothing you rail at all Women; <hi>Orpheus</hi> did it firſt, and you know the reaſon, and he met with too eaſy a <hi>Puniſhment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You are very careful to Communicate your grave advice to all our <hi>Sex,</hi> whether <hi>Beauties</hi> or otherwiſe; but in this one thing you are <hi>ingenuous,</hi> when you own you do not expect it will have any great <hi>effect</hi> upon us. No body Loves to have <hi>good Counſel cramm'd</hi> down their Throats, and to take it like Pills, or a Portion; beſides, ſhould a <hi>declar'd Enemy</hi> juſt before an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,</hi> or in the very heat of <hi>Fight</hi> have ſuch an extraordinary <hi>qualm</hi> of <hi>Civility</hi> come upon him, as to deſire you to taſte of a Cordial that he carry'd about with him, would not you, to return his Compliment, deſire him to taſte it before you, and think that after him was manners? Which if he refus'd, you would have juſt reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that all was not right at bottom. But ſo it is here, you give us ſome <hi>ſnarling Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments</hi> againſt <hi>Vanity, Pride, Infidelity, Scurrility, Inconſtancy,</hi> and a hundred other vices, when your own <hi>Sex</hi> ſo notoriouſly wants reformation, in all thoſe inſtances more then <hi>ours.</hi> And you do this in a ſowr and Magiſterial manner, when you are at

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41990:70"/>Affairs, values not how much the World is embroyl'd by their Fooliſh manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               </p>
               <p>You may be ſometimes great in little things, but you muſt of neceſſity be little in greater: You have neither <hi>Fund,</hi> nor <hi>Credit,</hi> nor <hi>Skill,</hi> nor <hi>Induſtry,</hi> to make any matters out in your way of Trading: <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdaſhes</hi> of <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> little <hi>under-Springs</hi> and <hi>Letter-carriers,</hi> you may make aſhift at, but with <hi>Wholeſale</hi> you'll never do.</p>

               <p>Your very <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Privity</hi> in any <hi>matter</hi> of great <hi>concern,</hi> is enough to <hi>ruine</hi> it: Nay, even in miſchief it ſelf, which is more your <hi>Element;</hi> and the reaſon why ſo few Plots ever take effect, may very well be, becauſe there are women ingag'd in 'em. Their Natural Love to miſchief makes 'em firſt <hi>embark</hi> in 'em, and their as <hi>Natural Folly</hi> to diſcover 'em: Nor need we wiſh our <hi>worst Enemies</hi> any greater <hi>misfortune,</hi> then to have a <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>women</hi> to <hi>direct</hi> 'em.</p>

                  <q>the <hi>preſent</hi> only is <hi>your Lot,</hi>
                  </q> you are born <hi>half Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures,</hi> for <hi>paſt</hi> and <hi>future</hi> never trouble you. You are above taking <hi>warning</hi> either by your <hi>own,</hi> or others <hi>Example.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Smart</hi> it ſelf won't make you wiſe, and yet that, one wou'd think, were the moſt <hi>proper way</hi> to inſtruct you, to make <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes</hi> to your <hi>ſence,</hi> when ſo perfectly <hi>deaf</hi> to all <hi>Reaſon.</hi>

               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:41990:73"/>
               <p>When you pleaſe we are fickle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, and don't know our minds: Be it ſo, but there you grant we have the higheſt degree of <hi>Secrecy imaginable,</hi> for ſure enough, if we are not conſcious to our own thoughts, they can never be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd to others.</p>
               <p>And that this is more then <hi>flouriſh,</hi> we had a <hi>notable Inſtance,</hi> not many Ages ſince, in our <hi>own Nation,</hi> of a woman who ruled with at leaſt as much ſucceſs, as any Prince that ever yet ſway'd the Scepter of theſe <hi>Realms,</hi> who under an appearing Fickleneſs of Temper, diſguis'd the moſt refin'd <hi>Policy,</hi> to that Degree, that her Enemies grew Mad that they cou'd not penetrate into her Intentions, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed how ſhou'd they, when oftentimes her moſt <hi>Intimate Counſellors</hi> did not <hi>know</hi> them?</p>
               <p>But we are not ſo firm and reſolv'd as your <hi>Sex,</hi> and how ſhou'd we, generally ſpeaking, or how can you reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it of us, or do you deſire we ſhou'd be ſo, tho you blame us for the contrary? What experience have we in <hi>things,</hi> which you take all the care you can to keep us from, and wou'd fain make us <hi>Ignorant,</hi> that our <hi>Devotion</hi> may be the greater to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch <hi>Idols</hi> as your ſelves? But when Women are once well enter'd into Buſineſs and Acquainted with it, who more <hi>Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious</hi> and <hi>Indefatigable?</hi> More quick to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41990:73"/>eſpy all Advantages, and ward off any <hi>croſs blows,</hi> wherein you can't deny we excell you. Then we are more <hi>unſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> you Men generally carry a <hi>Buſy Face</hi> with you, you would fain look wiſe, and ſometimes are miſtaken for Polititians, juſt like the good <hi>Long-bearded Shepherds,</hi> which are ſaid to dreſs up in <hi>Robes</hi> of <hi>State</hi> at the Court of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and ſet 'em all round a Room when the <hi>Czar</hi> gives an Audience, or Entertainment to any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <hi>Embaſſador.</hi> But the miſchief is, you ſpeak and ſpoil all, while they are as grave and ſilent as the <hi>Figures</hi> in the <hi>Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and if they can but <hi>ſtroak</hi> their <hi>Beards Majestically,</hi> they diſcharge their truſt like able <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now we are in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd of the Princeſs <hi>Sophia,</hi> who recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd two <hi>Brothers,</hi> equally Jealous of their <hi>Authority,</hi> which ſhe little leſs then ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with 'em both, for many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Give us ſuch an Inſtance in your own <hi>Sex</hi> for twenty Ages back, and we'll own 'em equally capable with our own, of engaging in ſuch matters.</p>
               <p>The plain truth is, as I've already hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you dare not ordinarily truſt us with <hi>Affairs</hi> of <hi>Moment,</hi> leaſt we ſhould ſee your <hi>Blunders,</hi> and <hi>Correct</hi> 'em; you dare not Learn us to <hi>fence,</hi> leaſt we ſhould <hi>beat</hi> our <hi>Maſters.</hi> Give me leave to tell ye one ſtory Sir <hi>T.</hi> and then we'll take
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41990:74"/>breath by conſent. Your modeſt Sex had formerly <hi>Monopoliz'd</hi> the whole <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Medies,</hi> and Chirurgery to your ſelves, even <hi>Midwiſery</hi> among the reſt, which they would by no means <hi>Communicate</hi> to us, how proper ſoever the knowledge of it was for us?</p>
               <p>But it happen'd that a cunning Slut of a Girl, having a great mind to pick out ſomewhat of theſe matters, diſguis'd her ſelf in Mans Cloaths, and got her ſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd by a Noted Phyſitian, who in <hi>proceſs</hi> of time taught her his <hi>Art:</hi> Well, away ſhe goes from him, when ſhe had Learnt what ſhe came for, and being ſoon after ſent for by ſome Women, ſhe made her ſelt known to 'em, who keeping it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves (tho they were women) employ'd her with all their <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> and <hi>broke</hi> her <hi>Maſter</hi> and the reſt of the Phyſitians; at which they being enrag'd, accus'd this ſhe-man-<hi>Midwife</hi> before the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> of being over-intimate with the <hi>Good wives,</hi> and that way getting all their <hi>cuſtom.</hi> Which ſlander the poor <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> had an eaſy way to confute, and accordingly was forc'd to make uſe on't to the <hi>Confuſion</hi> of her Adverſaries, and from that time, that <hi>Art</hi> has been chiefly manag'd by <hi>our Sex,</hi> and the ſame ſucceſs we have, doubtleſs, (had we the ſame advantages) we ſhou'd likewiſe meet with in all others.</p>

               <p>BUT I wiſh I were ſure of being out of their Reach before I begun with 'em, for they have terrible Fangs; and if they get me within 'em, I muſt be forc'd to compound for one Eye and Ear, to ſave the others.</p>
               <p>Nay, 'tis dangerous venturing ſo much as within ſight of 'em, for <hi>Anacreon</hi>'s <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,</hi> even of a <hi>Beauty,</hi> agrees to 'em in ſome Senſe, tho' widely different from that wherein he intended it.</p>

               <p>As charming a Sight doubtleſs as <hi>Don Quixot</hi> in his <hi>ſhort Shirt,</hi> and full as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible. Fate it ſelf holds not faſter than one of theſe <hi>loving Furies.</hi> The Story of the <hi>Gorgons</hi> I'm apt to believe was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but three <hi>old Maids,</hi> who liv'd together ſo long till they frighted Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind almoſt into Marble whenever their loathſome Faces, and ſnaky Hairs peep'd thro' the Caſement.</p>
               <p>And yet one wou'd wonder how ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable a Creature cou'd be ſo terrible: Is there any thing in Nature ſo mean, ſo uſeleſs, ſo contemptible?—An old Moth is worth a Regiment of 'em: But I ask their pardon, for on better Thoughts I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they ſet up all the <hi>Match-brokers</hi> and <hi>Fortune-tellers</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and are <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>liberal Benefactors</hi> to thoſe two <hi>noble Societies.</hi> As credulous they are, as he muſt be, who will believe the thouſandth part of the Stories they tell of their youthful Amours:— When they might have bin marry'd, they'd have you know, (and lick their Lips at the luſcious Imagination) ſo long ſince, and ſo often, in ſuch and ſuch a King's Reign, to that <hi>Parſon,</hi> and this <hi>Lawyer,</hi> and t'other <hi>pretty Gentleman.</hi> Thus wou'd they talk over <hi>another Age;</hi> and if any thing cou'd make 'em young agen, beſides what they dream of every Night, certainly this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe wou'd do it. Thus far however
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41990:75"/>you may venture to believe 'em, that they have had many fair <hi>Proffers</hi> in their time, ſince they themſelves have made 'em.</p>
               <p>But one good Quality they have; they are not Envious, any more than an elder Siſter, when the younger is marry'd before her: Nor Malicious, any otherwiſe than an <hi>African</hi> Lady to one who refuſes her: Nor <hi>Talkative, Ten-Fulling-Mills</hi> may make a ſhift at leaſt to keep pace with one of their Modeſt <hi>Clacks,</hi> if not to ſilence 'em, and make 'em as dumb as a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Add to this the <hi>Gravity</hi> of their <hi>Beards,</hi> the Decency of their <hi>Muſtachio's;</hi> the <hi>pleaſant Downy,</hi> charming <hi>Moſſy Subſtance,</hi> that uſually adorns their <hi>Lips</hi> and <hi>Chins,</hi> and qualifies 'em ſo admirably well for the Honour of being the Counteſs of <hi>Trifaldi</hi>'s Waiting-Gentlewomen.</p>
               <p>Had they all as many Hands as <hi>Briareus,</hi> and every one arm'd with as many <hi>Twee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi> there wou'd be full Employment for 'em all, in eradicating this <hi>Malicious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement;</hi> which if it grew a little cloſer, they might perhaps make a Virtue of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and find ſome ingenious Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, to matt it into a ſort of a Velvet Mask, and hide it ſelf as well as their <hi>Faces.</hi>

               </byline>
               <p>NOthing is more obvious than Recri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in all theſe Caſes, and the <hi>Old Batchellor</hi> Sir <hi>T.</hi> would be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Match for your <hi>Old Maids.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But not to inſiſt always on that Method of <hi>Defence,</hi> which beſides cannot imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately affect you, Sir <hi>T.</hi> who would be reckon'd a <hi>young Widower,</hi> I rather ask leave to inſiſt on ſome of the <hi>Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> and <hi>Excellencies</hi> of <hi>Old Maids,</hi> whom your uncivil <hi>Sex</hi> ſo much deſpiſes.</p>
               <p>Uugrateful Men, that you are, tho' you cannot remember your Infancy, do not you believe you were once Children?— Yes, and muſt be ſo agen, if you live much longer, and in both thoſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, if you conſider'd the indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Uſe of a careful <hi>Old Maid,</hi> you would have Gratitude, or at leaſt more Wit, than thus to rail againſt 'em</p>
               <p>How many wakeful Nights, and weary Days have the poor Souls worn out in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41990:77"/>young <hi>Maſter's Service,</hi> who now ſo little regards 'em? How many Garters have they broke in rocking him? What terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Colds, and Rheums, and Aches, in taking him up, and walking up and down the Room with him in cold Froſty Nights, to quiet him. Nay, how much precious Juice have the poor Creatures wrung out of their own dry Gums, to mix with his Pap, when feeding him, that it might not burn him,—and all, all for ever forgotten? Where's Gratitude, where's Honour or Sympathy, or Generoſity? Meer Names and Shadows, and Romantic Tales, like thoſe which theſe poor forſaken <hi>Dry Nurſes</hi> were wont to tell their Children to quiet 'em.</p>
               <p>Well, comfort your ſelves, <hi>Poor Hearts,</hi> tho'. by this time they are got to their Breeches, and can put 'em up and down, without your help, you'll ſee 'em agen ſooner then you imagin. They run faſt; their Race will ſoon be over, and they'll come agen, and be a ſecond time under your Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, ſooner than you or they are aware.</p>
               <p>Do but live honeſtly, and without fretting; and when they come to be <hi>Old Men,</hi> you'll find but little difference in your own Ages ſince you firſt nurſs'd 'em.</p>
               <p>This they muſt come to agen, and one would expect they ſhould be more civil for that reaſon, as the Fellow once was to the Devil himſelf, whom he would not
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41990:78"/>hear abuſed, becauſe he did not know whoſe Hands he might fall into.</p>
               <p>The ſame Watching, the ſame Tucking up, the ſame warm Cloaths, and Flannel, and Candles they uſed to have when they were young; It may be too you muſt come into Bed to his old Worſhip, as you did to his young Worſhip, to cheriſh him, and keep him warm, and rub him for the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> and <hi>you</hi> may do it without any Scandal or Danger; alas! the harmleſs Creature, 't has no more Hurt in't than a <hi>Chryſom Infant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be 'twill Smirk a little, now and den, and be waggiſh, and chirrup, but that's all, and you know there's no hurt in't.</p>
               <p>It uſed to Puke mightily when 'twas Young; a good <hi>Sign,</hi> and a <hi>thriving Child</hi> I warn't it: Why juſt ſo it ſpits now for all the VVorld, and Miſtreſs Nurſe will be more put to't to keep it dry, and muſt be changing its Bib four or five times in four and twenty Hours.</p>
               <p>Some times it wants to riſe to—and then <hi>Nurſe</hi> muſt be call'd, and many a <hi>ſore tug</hi> muſt ſhe have with him; for now the Child grows heavy, and you wou'd not think how much Care is requir'd to keep it <hi>Sweet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, 'tis as <hi>froward,</hi> poor thing, as if t'had got the <hi>Gripes,</hi> or was cutting its <hi>Eye-Teeth</hi> agen. <hi>Nurſe,</hi>—why <hi>Nurſe</hi>-where

               <p>AMong the other Diſcourſes, I've for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly maintain'd with your <hi>Nimble-Tongue Ladyſhip,</hi> you know I blam'd your Sexes <hi>Forwardneſs</hi> and <hi>Fondneſs;</hi> and I think I juſtly blam'd 'em, which I now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to prove, and that I may pleaſe you, I'll do it very <hi>Methodically,</hi> firſt the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact it ſelf, and then the miſchief and Folly and Inconvenience of it, to your <hi>ſelves</hi> as well as <hi>others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that you are <hi>Fond,</hi> that your whole Sex is <hi>fond</hi> and <hi>forward,</hi> and have been coming above theſe 5000 years, and <hi>ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> back to your <hi>Ribb</hi> again, ſure you <hi>your ſelves</hi> will ſcarce <hi>deny.</hi> We have no more Inſtances of it, then there have been <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals</hi> of your <hi>teizing Sex</hi> ſince the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:41990:79"/>
               <p>I have ſaid enough on't I ſuppoſe alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and have ſatisfy'd you, as to <hi>old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> and <hi>old Maids,</hi> which let me tell you, make up a great part of your Corporation, being preſerv'd amongſt you, as the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> do their <hi>Grandmothers,</hi> dry'd and ſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, for I know not how many Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now if even theſe make a ſhift to keep a <hi>Colts Tooth,</hi> when they have hardly had more then Stumps in their Heads, ſince the <hi>Camp</hi> at <hi>Tilbury,</hi> what a fine ſet may we believe are in yours, that are as wild as the wind, and all your youth and blood about ye? Even they are ready to over-run poor Mankind, and then ſure you muſt be like to run into 'em. You muſt own your ſelves fond or cruel, for you are always in <hi>extreams,</hi> the latter you dare not, leſt we ſhou'd take you at your word, and therefore we may take the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to conclude the former. Is it not fondneſs with a Witneſs to leave your Parents, to run away from your Friends and Guardians; to ſtraddle over Garden-walls, and fly in the Air like Witches, and ride over Houſe-Tops like Cats; to ruſh through Darkneſs, and wade through <hi>Moats,</hi> and almoſt run through <hi>Fire</hi> as well as <hi>Water?</hi> And what is all this for? Is it not for <hi>Man,</hi> that Charming Creature, <hi>Man,</hi> whom when <hi>you're</hi> in an ill humour you'll not afford a <hi>good word,</hi> and d'ye do all this, think ye, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41990:80"/>ſome little kind of Inclination, ſome ſort of <hi>kindly call</hi> from Nature, like that of the <hi>Land-Crabbs;</hi> who moſt <hi>amorouſly</hi> crawl over <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Houſes,</hi> or whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver elſe happens to ſtand in their way, that they mayn't fail the Aſſignation made 'em, with thoſe of their own <hi>Species,</hi> who come from Sea, I know not how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Leagues to meet 'em?</p>
               <p>What an infinite of Paper d'ye ſpoil in a Year? How many <hi>Heydleberg-Tuns</hi> full of Ink do you Squander away, in anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Billet-doux,</hi> and <hi>Love-Letters;</hi>—or rather, in ſending 'em, and <hi>challenging</hi> all Mankind to do the worſt they can at your <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Reputations?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you need not <hi>write,</hi> you can <hi>ſpeak</hi> enough, and you have many <hi>ways</hi> to do it: Your <hi>Eyes,</hi> your <hi>Hands,</hi> your every <hi>Motion,</hi> ſufficiently expreſs how unwilling you are to be thought <hi>Man-haters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And tho' our poor <hi>Perſecuted Sex</hi> ſhou'd endeavour to keep out of ſight, how many different ſubtle Ways have you to enſnare us?</p>
               <p>Sometimes you get a <hi>tame Man,</hi> as the <hi>Fowler</hi> does a <hi>Duck,</hi> or the Maſter of the <hi>Elephants</hi> one of the ſame <hi>Species,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coy us from our Native Freedom, into your fatal <hi>Nooſe.</hi> Sometimes a <hi>He,</hi> tho' oftener a <hi>She-Friend,</hi> becauſe you can ſerve 'em agen in the ſame manner. I have heard of many, who have meerly bin talkt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41990:80"/>into your <hi>Snares,</hi> and of ſome few that have bin <hi>beaten,</hi> and <hi>fairly cudgell'd</hi> into an <hi>Amour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe, and a thouſand ways have you more, as various as your <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſitions,</hi> to obtain and ſecure your Lovers, tho' you know you have already over-rul'd us in a very great Point, as to thoſe Matters:—You make us the <hi>Aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,</hi> that you may have the Honour, and the Pleaſure, to ſee us at your <hi>Feet,</hi> and hug your ſelves at the Excellency of your own <hi>Diſſimulation.</hi> What <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, when you love a Man more than even your <hi>Sloth,</hi> or <hi>Eaſe,</hi> or <hi>Vanity,</hi> to hold off ſtill, and pretend you are not as willing as he? No, you are made of more <hi>refin'd Mould:</hi> Another ſort of <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> you'd have us think, from what we are compos'd of. Hence the <hi>eternal Teizings,</hi> the <hi>Put-offs,</hi> the <hi>Fetches,</hi> the <hi>Doubles,</hi> wherewith your poor Dog in a String, that does not know you muſt be a long while tormented:— And yet 'tis all Fondneſs ſtill, tho' in another Shape, as they ſay the <hi>Tune-ſeen Ladies bite hardeſt,</hi> when they are moſt furiouſly pleaſed. 'Tis to keep us from diſcovering the Cheat as long as you can; for after a while you know 'tis too late:—for when you once have obtain'd what you deſire, you are ten thouſand times <hi>fonder</hi> and <hi>madder</hi> than ever:—And well remembred of the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41990:81"/>Miſchiefs that follow this <hi>Burdock Temper.</hi> In the firſt place, you know, that we know your-<hi>Sex</hi> in general; and that if you don't <hi>diſſemble</hi> very artificially, you miſs what you aim at, your <hi>Forwardneſs</hi> being ſo odious, that you loſe us before you have us. Nothing can be imagin'd more nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous than your perpetual <hi>Siege,</hi> and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh <hi>Kindneſs.</hi> Were you all <hi>Nector</hi> and <hi>Ambraſio,</hi> you'd tire us with cramming us thus every day. Have you any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to make your ſelves cheaper than you are already, or more <hi>diſagreeable?</hi> Gueſs but by your ſelves whether ſuch a Temper can pleaſe, and if it's poſſible, cure your ſelves of it, and avoid it. For you'd ſcarce take it well your ſelves to be kiſs'd to Death.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing in the World ſo <hi>tireſome</hi> and <hi>impertinent</hi> as a downright <hi>doting Lover,</hi> even while there's yet ſome relliſh in him, and before he's a Husband? He haunts ye like your <hi>Shadow,</hi> and will hardly give you room to breathe, eſpecially if <hi>you</hi> let him have the leaſt Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for then there's no enduring him. He'll follow ye to the Garden, to your Chamber, when <hi>you</hi> are a viſiting: Hound him off never ſo frequently and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the importunate Cur will ſtill be a <hi>hanger on,</hi> lie upon your <hi>Petticoats,</hi> lick your <hi>Hands,</hi>—ay, your <hi>Lips</hi> too if he can come at 'em, with as much <hi>Savour,</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:41990:81"/>and as good a <hi>Grace</hi> as the <hi>Aſs</hi> did his Maſter's. If you wou'd ſcarce be pleaſed with this, you ſhou'd take Care to avoid a reſembling Practice. Beware of a hoit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fooliſh Behaviour; been't ambitious of Conqueſts; if you get one that's worth a keeping, ſhow your <hi>Diſcretion</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining him, and above all things, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tire him, nor kill him with <hi>Kindneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if you reſolve to perſiſt in theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies, and of one ſide Inſult and Triumph over your <hi>Adorers,</hi> while on the other Extream you ſo viſibly doat upon 'em, that you are ready to ſuck their <hi>Eyes</hi> out; you ought to take Heed that you don't at laſt tire our <hi>Patience,</hi> and make us perfectly deſperate, the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whereof might be worſe than you can imagine; for do but conſider what a Condition you'd be in, ſhou'd you once provoke us to turn all <hi>He-Amazons,</hi> and ſet up a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of our own <hi>Sex,</hi> with Excluſion of yours.</p>

               <p>'TIS a very hard Task to pleaſe ſuch as are reſolv'd to find fault before hand, and to deal with our poor Sex as the <hi>Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Fellow</hi> thought to have done with the <hi>Oracle,</hi> who wou'd prove 'twas in an <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> whether it Anſwer'd that the <hi>Sparrow</hi> were <hi>Alive</hi> or <hi>Dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we ſhow the leaſt modeſt <hi>Kindneſs</hi> or <hi>Inclination,</hi> you preſently <hi>rail</hi> at us for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent and looſe Creatures, if we keep you at a greater diſtance, and juſtly take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the <hi>Perfidiouſneſs</hi> of <hi>your Sex,</hi> and the <hi>misfortunes</hi> of <hi>our own;</hi> then we are <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Inſulting,</hi> and abuſe that <hi>Power</hi> and that <hi>Beauty,</hi> that <hi>Nature</hi> has given us. However, ſince 'tis ſafer <hi>erring</hi> of the <hi>right hand,</hi> and it will <hi>oblige</hi> you too ſo extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it's <hi>pity</hi> but you ſhou'd be <hi>pleas'd,</hi> and kept as far off as you <hi>deſire,</hi> by all thoſe whom you are ſo <hi>terribly</hi> affraid of.</p>
               <p>But in the mean while, I beſeech you let's have no more <hi>complaints</hi> of the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of <hi>Women,</hi> when you are ſo much more <hi>Camelions your</hi> ſelves, that the <hi>Colour</hi> of your <hi>mind</hi> changes every moment: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41990:82"/>you are for <hi>Simplicity</hi> and an <hi>Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous open temper,</hi> and rail at us all for <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,</hi> but before you have drawn in that <hi>railing breath</hi> again, you are as <hi>angry</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we <hi>don't diſſemble,</hi> and wou'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, that nothing can pleaſe you, but what you think meer <hi>Cheat</hi> and <hi>Falſehood.</hi> The thing in ſhort is <hi>this,</hi> that if after a thouſand <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Proteſtations</hi> and <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> and Vows of inviolable <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Service,</hi> we have no more <hi>wit</hi> then to believe you, and it may be at laſt give <hi>you hopes,</hi> only to be rid on <hi>you,</hi> not being Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of <hi>your Generous Temper,</hi> and well knowing that to be the <hi>readieſt way,</hi> then immediately we are all that <hi>you</hi> call us, and <hi>twenty favours</hi> more then <hi>you</hi> ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, muſt be <hi>Boaſted</hi> of to the next <hi>vain Fellow</hi> that has <hi>Patience</hi> to hear <hi>you,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> to believe <hi>you,</hi> or it may be to the next <hi>poor Credulous</hi> Creature, that you're deſigning to <hi>ruine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But is this ſo very <hi>Generous</hi> as you'd fain be thought, ſo like thoſe Men of <hi>Honour</hi> for which you'd be ſo much valu'd, firſt to <hi>undo,</hi> and then to <hi>upbraid;</hi> to <hi>tempt</hi> firſt, and then to <hi>reproach</hi> and <hi>torment</hi> thoſe with whom you've prevail'd?</p>
               <p>If our <hi>Sex</hi> were really ſo <hi>eaſy</hi> as <hi>you</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, how came <hi>you</hi> to take ſo much <hi>pains</hi> to <hi>win</hi> 'em? What makes <hi>you</hi> ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten talk ſo frightfully of <hi>Rapes</hi> and <hi>Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> and <hi>Poiſons,</hi> and <hi>Precipices.</hi> Which
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41990:83"/>tho it's true, we are now ſo well Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, that we take 'em only as words of <hi>courſe,</hi> and no more to be heeded then thoſe <hi>Oaths,</hi> with which you <hi>Garniſh your Courtſhip,</hi> yet 'tis not impoſſible, that it may be true, ſince it has been ſo formerly; There have been thoſe of your <hi>Sagacities,</hi> who have thought fit to <hi>hang</hi> or <hi>beat</hi> their <hi>Brains</hi> out, to ſhow the height of their paſſion, and the Sincerity of their <hi>Love;</hi> And was there over much <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> think <hi>you,</hi> in ſuch caſes as theſe, or was't the <hi>Fondneſs</hi> of their Miſtreſſes, that brought 'em to ſuch an <hi>Exit?</hi>

               <p>But be all this <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe</hi> before <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> let us then be fond or otherwiſe, I'd fain know Sir, why you are ſo angry with us, for Loving too well afterwards, which I confeſs, I thought was no Crime, or at leaſt one that might eaſily be <hi>pardon'd;</hi> Unleſs it be, becauſe <hi>you</hi> are affraid <hi>you</hi> ſhall want an <hi>excuſe</hi> to <hi>uſe us ill,</hi> if we ſhou'd continue thus doating on <hi>you.</hi> But even that too may be cur'd, for I dare promiſe for my ſelf, and moſt that I know, that we are not incorrigible, if <hi>you</hi> complain of us, we'll try whether we can amend; all things are eaſy to a <hi>willing mind,</hi> and eſpecially to thoſe who are encourag'd by <hi>your edifying</hi> Examples.

               <p>WEre one of our <hi>Europeans</hi> caſt any where on a <hi>Barbarous ſhore,</hi> and ſhou'd he be ſaluted at his <hi>Arrival</hi> with the <hi>diverting ſight</hi> of a <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Savages, capering</hi> about with their <hi>Gimminy-Gomminy</hi> till they foam'd and dropt down on the <hi>Spot,</hi> would he not have reaſon to think 'em all, all either Drunk or Mad?</p>
               <p>And juſt the ſame, 'tis very probable, wou'd be the opinion of one of them, ſhou'd we ſhow 'em one of our <hi>Balls</hi> or
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41990:84"/>
                  <hi>Dancing Schools,</hi> for the beſt we can ſay for 'em is, that there's ſome <hi>method</hi> in this Madneſs.</p>
               <p>I dare almoſt be confident, that 'twas ſome <hi>Woman</hi> firſt invented <hi>Dancing,</hi> 'tis ſo odd, ſo <hi>Whimfical,</hi> ſo <hi>Ridiculous</hi> an <hi>Exerciſe.</hi> Standing ſtill, turning <hi>round,</hi> now on <hi>one Leg,</hi> then <hi>t'other,</hi> running full-drive, ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>Stately;</hi> down to the <hi>Ground,</hi> up to the <hi>Branches</hi> forward, backward, ſideways, every way, <hi>joyning hands, parting</hi> 'em, <hi>patting, kiſſing, ogling, touching, whiſpering, graſping,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all that follows, enough to <hi>ruin</hi> an <hi>Angel,</hi> for ſure if thoſe Spirits were ever pickt up by your Sex, as ſome of the Learned have <hi>fancy'd,</hi> 'twas <hi>Dancing</hi> firſt <hi>Debauch'd</hi> 'em.</p>
               <p>You have us here juſt as you deſire, you give us a look like a flaſh of Lightning, and away again, ſo quick and ſhort you move, that we han't time to diſcover your real imperfections, but are dazled with your appearing Beauties.</p>
               <p>We are warm'd before with the violent motion, and then 'tis no great matter for you to kindle us, eſpecially when we have ſuch a deal of <hi>Tinder,</hi> ſo many rich <hi>Silks Ruſtling</hi> on every ſide of us.</p>
               <p>A convenient School, really to inſtruct Youth, and a very happy occaſion to bring many a Loving pair together.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially your <hi>Masks</hi> and <hi>Balls,</hi> where <hi>modeſty</hi> and <hi>virtue</hi> are hardly ſo much as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41990:84"/>pretended to. Where the Lady may meet her Gallant, and walk off with him, tho her Husband ſtands within two ſteps of her. Where the <hi>Curtains</hi> are as good as drawn, as ſoon as they come thither, and an infallible cure for bluſhing, if there ſhou'd be any ſparks of modeſty left.</p>
               <p>I wou'd ask how many have been ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd at theſe places? were it not much more eaſy to Anſwer me, how many who have conſtantly frequented em, did ever <hi>eſcape Ruine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I don't at <hi>all wonder</hi> that <hi>Witches</hi> are ſaid to uſe this Dancing, ſo conſtantly at their <hi>Deteſtable Sabbaths</hi> and <hi>Midnight Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,</hi> ſince 'tis a <hi>Diverſion</hi> as <hi>Wild</hi> and as <hi>Fantaſtical</hi> as their <hi>Imaginations.</hi> But I can't be ſatisfy'd why any Perſons ſhou'd practice it, nay dote upon it, who pretend to <hi>Senſe, Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Virtue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis indeed ſo fooliſh a <hi>cuſtom,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſo many ill Conſequences with it, that <hi>Judicatures</hi> of far <hi>different Nations,</hi> and in other matters of very <hi>oppoſite opinions</hi> have agreed to Condemn it. The <hi>Inquiſition</hi> and <hi>Geneva</hi> are both of one mind in this matter, at leaſt the one has forbidden a <hi>Sarabrand,</hi> as the other all manner of <hi>Dancing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I don't think it ſtrange, that the <hi>French</hi> ſhou'd be ſo much fonder on't then all the other Nations of <hi>Europe.</hi> They ſpeak, and walk, and talk, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41990:85"/>ſing, and preach, and I fancy, are almoſt <hi>Born</hi> and dye <hi>Dancing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There's a <hi>Palſey</hi> ſure in their <hi>Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> a ſort of a natural <hi>impreſt motion</hi> on their <hi>Minds</hi> and <hi>Bodys,</hi> which will no more let 'em ceaſe to <hi>move</hi> then ceaſe to <hi>be.</hi> One wou'd think every one of 'em carry'd a large <hi>Bladder</hi> of <hi>Quickſilver</hi> in their <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> and that they Danc'd about as that will before the <hi>Fire,</hi> or as a Leaf is canted round in a <hi>Whirlwind,</hi> by a purely <hi>involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>French</hi> Court ſome time ſince fell upon that <hi>Mad Frolick,</hi> whoſe Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Hiſtorians have left us, and wou'd <hi>Dance</hi> in the ſhape of <hi>wild Horſes,</hi> on all <hi>four,</hi> with abundance of <hi>Flax</hi> inſtead of <hi>Manes,</hi> in one of which a ſpark of a <hi>Flambeau</hi> lit, and ſet 'em all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, I wonder the <hi>Maskers</hi> did not rather chuſe to be burnt to <hi>Coals</hi> then neglect to <hi>Dance</hi> out their <hi>Dance,</hi> and how they cou'd ever be brought to admit of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys Petticoats</hi> for Extinguiſhers, tho 'twas to ſave their <hi>Lives.</hi>

               <p>I'm eaſily induc'd to believe what you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in the Beginning of your <hi>Letter,</hi> that ſhou'd a <hi>Barbarian</hi> ſee the <hi>Polite</hi> part of the World at a <hi>Ball</hi> or <hi>Dancing-School,</hi> he wou'd think us all what he really was himſelf, and in a <hi>Barbarian</hi> ſuch a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be excus'd, who has hardly more skill in <hi>Numbers</hi> then one that's Born a Fool, or then a <hi>Brute Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for one who has a <hi>Notion</hi> of theſe things, who looks as if he cou'd think, and wou'd fain perſwade us he can reaſon, for ſuch a one to compare the <hi>Courtly</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular motions</hi> of our <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and <hi>Ladies,</hi> directed by the <hi>Muſick,</hi> and keeping time exactly with it, to the <hi>Barbarous Anticks</hi> of the <hi>Savage Africans;</hi> this I confeſs, wou'd amaze me, had I not before heard his <hi>Character,</hi> and underſtood by all his Letters, I've yet ſeen, that his <hi>Soul</hi> is out of <hi>Tune,</hi> and for that reaſon he can neither endure to <hi>hear</hi> or <hi>ſee Muſick.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:41990:86"/>
               <p>For <hi>Dancing</hi> is nothing elſe but <hi>beating</hi> thoſe meaſures with our <hi>Feet,</hi> which the <hi>Artiſt</hi> does with his <hi>Fingers,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Inſtrument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis a ſort of a <hi>Living Muſick,</hi> and the <hi>Heart</hi> keeps time with the <hi>reſt</hi> of the <hi>Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nature</hi> it ſelf is a <hi>greater Dancer</hi> then the moſt <hi>volatile Creature</hi> ſhe ever yet fram'd, ſhe does nothing without motion: Something at firſt Danc'd out of nothing. The <hi>Orbs</hi> fell a Dancing as ſoon as they were made, and will continue ſo till they are reduc'd to nothing.</p>
               <p>What is there you blame in Dancing? You dare not come where 'tis for fear of <hi>Temptation,</hi> ſtay away then, and make room for thoſe who are honeſter, and have no ſuch bad thoughts to diſturb 'em.</p>
               <p>If there's no hurt in ſingly walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, leaping, or turning, how ſhou'd there be in theſe all together? Or does the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick make it Criminal, or the Company, neither of which wou'd be ſo if divided? Or is there any <hi>Evil</hi> inſeparably annex'd to it, or have we any <hi>Law</hi> either <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Humane</hi> that forbids it, except that of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> neither of which I ſuppoſe you think Infallible.</p>
               <p>But it nouriſhes and flatters Love, and feeds and fans the Flame already too <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant.</hi> And grant it does ſo, was a <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Love</hi> ever eſteemed <hi>Disgraceful?</hi> Is't
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41990:86"/>not a kindly, a natural and a Generous <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and wou'd not every wiſe Commonwealth do well, as I've read ſome have done, by all <hi>Decent</hi> and <hi>Lawful</hi> ways to <hi>Promote</hi> and <hi>Encourage</hi> it?</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Abuſes</hi> of this ſprightly, heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Exerciſe, to argue from thence for the taking away its uſe, is ſo mean a Fallacy that it's ſcarce worth the taking notice of, much leſs the Anſwering: I expect you'll be ſhortly for pulling down <hi>Churches</hi> too, becauſe 'tis ſaid, they are too often ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abuſed by <hi>Intrigues</hi> and <hi>Aſſignations.</hi>

               </head>
               <byline>By Mr. <hi>RICH.</hi>
               </byline>
               <p>YOu know who ſays,
<q>
                     <l>You talk of <hi>Fires</hi> that <hi>ſhine,</hi> but never <hi>Burn;</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>In this <hi>cold World</hi> they'll hardly ſerve our turn.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And wou'd you for once be <hi>ingenuous,</hi> you muſt own your ſelves of the ſame mind. As all your Sex is one great <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,</hi> ſo this is one <hi>glareing Inſtance</hi> of their <hi>Prevarication:</hi> You may as well talk of Love without Loving as without defir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and when you can ſhow the <hi>Love-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> between a pair of Souls, or the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Angelical <hi>Amours</hi> of <hi>Nakar</hi> and <hi>Damilcar,</hi> or can tell me the taſte of thoſe <hi>Immaterial kiſſes</hi> which your <hi>Famous Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:41990:87"/>talkt of, then I ſhall begin to believe that you believe your ſelves, when you talk of theſe matters, and that you are full as Spiritual as you tell us; tho ſure you wou'd not have us <hi>take you at your word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not but that I verily believe your Love may ſtill be enough Platonical, and full as pure, as was that of the Philoſopher, who gave it the Name, who if he were not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much wrong'd, never lov'd Virtue ſo refinedly, as to like or <hi>Court</hi> her ſo <hi>Paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi> in a foul, or homely Habitation, as he did in thoſe that were more <hi>Beautiful</hi> and <hi>Lovely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of theſe two things then you can't hardly deny; either that 'tis only an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Name, or elſe a ſort of a Vizard to ſomething more homely: He that denys what he really is, makes us ſometimes vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſuſpect him what he is not, and as often find out what he takes ſuch over-care to conceal.</p>
               <p>Who that's wiſe wou'd attempt to Drink out of a Vial, which he knows has either nothing at all in it, or if any thing, the ſureſt and moſt ſubtle Poyſon in the World? If you ſay, there's a mean, and virtuous Love may be thus diſguis'd, I'd fain know what need on't? Neither Love, nor Truth, nor Virtue need ſeek Corners, not ſo much as the former, if he comes in Company with the latter. He ought therefore to be uncaſed, as <hi>Aphrodiſius</hi> in <hi>Pſyche,</hi> and tho
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41990:88"/>as finely dreſs'd as he, of whom that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Poet.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Yet you ought to be ſure, that you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace not a <hi>Serpent,</hi> inſtead of a <hi>God,</hi> or that he hides not a <hi>Satyrs</hi> deform'd and ſhaggy <hi>Figure,</hi> under the Wings of an Angel. The <hi>Shipwrack</hi> of ſo many before you, one wou'd be apt to think, ſhou'd make you affraid of the dangerous <hi>Voyage</hi> to Mrs. <hi>Behns Iſland:</hi> The <hi>Bones</hi> that you ſee, and the <hi>Skulls</hi> ſo near the Cave of this <hi>Sleeping-Lyon,</hi> ſhou'd keep you from venturing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his <hi>Paws,</hi> tho he <hi>ſheaths</hi> 'em never ſo Artificially. <hi>Platonick Love</hi> has ruin'd half your Sex, and you can't but know as much, and therefore ſeem to admit the pretences of it, only with a deſire to be undone more plauſibly, and to retain the ſhadow of Innocence, when the ſubſtance i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If you were but willing to eſcape De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and to come back from the brink of the precipice, it may be, it might not yet be impoſſible. Diſcover the Viper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>Pray do but perſwade any of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd Sparks to admire you at a diſtance, not to come near you, or if they do, at leaſt tantalize 'em, ſo as never to let 'em ſteal a Graſp or a Touch, and try if they can live on ſuch <hi>Airy Diet.</hi> The purer any Flame is, the leſs aliment it needs to ſupport it. Let 'em by this make a Tryal of theirs: Let 'em live a year, on <hi>not ſo much</hi> as a ſigh of pity: Let 'em converſe with your Souls only, and make Love to them, for which alone they pretend ſo great a Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but let 'em not ſo much as throw a look on your Body; nor their Eyes faſten one Glance on yours. For what has the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition</hi> and <hi>Embraces</hi> of <hi>Souls</hi> to do with theſe dull <hi>Material Organs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if neither they nor you can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with ſuch <hi>mortifying Diet,</hi> if you feel a ſort of a pain, and diſpleaſure, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs under ſuch a practice, and find this a force upon your Inclinations, and you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſigh, and wiſh, and think your ſelves unhappy: Then beware ſtings, for there's certainly no better nor worſe then meer <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> at the <hi>Bottom.</hi> For theſe paſſions ſeem not ſo properly ſeated in the mind, as the Body, or only in the <hi>ſenſible Soul,</hi> which is hardly different from it.</p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:41990:89"/>
               <p>The mind it ſelf is pure and Spiritual, Reaſon is a clam and a Noble Principle, it admits of no <hi>Emotions,</hi> or <hi>Perturbations;</hi> and thus the Angels love Mankind and one another: Whereas, if we believe Mr. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> (who might know as much of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as any <hi>Heywood</hi> of 'em all,) a <hi>fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>But Love's an inſinuating Devil, and if he gets but the tip of his <hi>Wing</hi> into your <hi>Heart,</hi> all the reſt quickly follows.</p>

               <byline>By Madam <hi>GODFREY</hi>—</byline>
               <p>YOU charge our Sex with a variable and unconſtant Temper, as <hi>fickle</hi> we muſt all be as the <hi>Wind,</hi> or as <hi>Fortune.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Man</hi> you'd have us think, that's the only firm and ſtable part of the Creation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, as <hi>Rocks,</hi> and fix'd on the ſolid <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> of his own Reſolution and Reaſon. <hi>Fix'd</hi> indeed you may be in <hi>Evil,</hi> as well as in a very ſtrong conceit of your own <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> but whether as <hi>change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> when you happen to be in the right, as that Sex, which is the object of your ſcorn, as inconſiſtent with your ſelves, and as falſe to your own aſſertions, if we had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant experience to ſatisfy us, you your ſelf wou'd be a ſufficient Inſtance. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 'tis true, you put on a ſort of a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial Air,</hi> and Dictate <hi>Morality</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> more as it ſhou'd ſeem, that you might appear <hi>Superior</hi> to our <hi>Sex,</hi> then for any real eſteem to that or us. But you ſoon forget your ſelf, are all infected with the <hi>Faſhionable Notions</hi> of the <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:41990:90"/>and diſcourſe juſt at their <hi>Rate,</hi> who pretend there's no ſuch thing as <hi>Virtue</hi> in our <hi>Sex,</hi> becauſe they wou'd be glad never to find it.</p>
               <p>And to convince any one that we do not ſcandalize you, we need but remit 'em to the beginning of your <hi>laſt Letter,</hi> which I ſhan't repeat, but leave it to any who are better pleas'd with ſuch diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>But pray why are you ſo furiouſly angry with <hi>Platonick Love,</hi> which you are forc'd your ſelf to own the ſame thing, or at leaſt not very different from a <hi>virtuous Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?</hi> Can any thing that's <hi>virtuous</hi> be either ſo Criminal, or ſo <hi>dangerous</hi> as you <hi>repreſent it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> as I think I've read in ſome of the Phyloſophers, can only be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Virtuous Perſons;</hi> and are all our <hi>Sex</hi> either <hi>unworthy</hi> or <hi>uncapable</hi> of it, or are you grown <hi>Ingenuous,</hi> ſhall we call it, or <hi>Malicious,</hi> in attempting to perſwade us the ſame of your <hi>own Sex,</hi> that you ſeem to believe of <hi>ours,</hi> that there's not one <hi>Spark</hi> of <hi>Virtue</hi> and true <hi>Generoſity</hi> left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt 'em?</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Grave Leſſons,</hi> what extraordinary care we ſhou'd take of ye, might be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: They ſeem to have ſome Face of Kindneſs, and to come from a Friend, tho a ſowr one. Had you therefore only advis'd us to take an extraordinary Care, with whom we contracted <hi>Friendſhips,</hi> to be firſt very well acquainted with 'em, to Act with <hi>caution</hi> at leaſt with 'em.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41990:91"/>if not too with ſome Reſerve, to be careful theſe Friendſhips did not croſs any other Obligations; nay, after all, to be ſtill upon our Guard againſt you, conſidering how ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous you are, and how virtuous, and to take care of our Reputations, as well as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence; all this, I ſay, we might have thankt you for, tho no more then what our Sex too often Learns from yours, in a more dangerous manner, ſince 'tis no ſuch great wonder to find among you a perjur'd and Faithleſs Friend, we have reaſon to wiſh it were not much more difficult to diſcover the contrary.</p>
               <p>But what we think we have reaſon to be angry at, is, that you wou'd totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude us from what is the Happineſs, as well as Perfection of our Natures, and one of the greateſt Bleſſings of Life.</p>
               <p>And yet we fondly flatter our ſelves, we ſhall either find you all Virtuous and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Friendſhip, or prevail with you to be ſo, or elſe why do we ever Marry you?</p>
               <p>None wou'd be a Slave to one that they believed Falſe and Perfidious, none in their Wits wou'd give their all to one they thought not ſo much as capable of Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty, or Honour, or a laſting Amity. Why d'you take ſo much pains before you have us faſt, to perſwade us you have thoſe <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications</hi> which may make you worthy our <hi>Friendſhip, Courage, Bounty, Fidelity,</hi> and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41990:91"/>the like? And where is't more likely, where wou'd one expect to find a perfect Unity of Sentiments, or Condeſcention, where there's any inconſiderable differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which I look upon as much of the Eſſence of Friendſhip? where that true and unbyaſt tenderneſs and kindneſs, which is the inſeparable effect of that Noble Virtue, as well as that entire Confidence which is rarely or never divided from it, but where Intereſt, and God, and Nature, and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies of States, and the Laws of Nations have before made the ſtricteſt Union?</p>
               <p>And if you are ſeldom capable of it, if you ſoon Learn to diſpiſe us, if you have little or no tenderneſs for us, or confidence, or eſteem, or ſo much as Inclination, and if we rarely ſee in a Marry'd State, laſting Inſtances of Friendſhip, we wou'd ask you whether it be either juſt, or modeſt, to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid us with your <hi>own Faults,</hi> and our great unhappineſs?</p>
               <p>But tho you're at Liberty, it muſt be confeſt, to make your ſelves as bad as you pleaſe, we won't make you worſe, and as ill as you are, as meanly as you think of us, and I wiſh there were no reaſon to ſay of Virtue too, yet we're ſatisfy'd you are not ſo Univerſally Corrupted, but there is ſome Faith and Friendſhip left amongſt you. There are ſome Inſtances of <hi>Love</hi> after <hi>Marriage,</hi> which I reckon only a higher Name for Friendſhip, and that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41990:92"/>ſhows it not <hi>impoſſible:</hi> Some <hi>happy Pairs,</hi> who know no <hi>Contentions,</hi> but who ſhall <hi>Love</hi> beſt and <hi>oblige</hi> moſt: Whoſe <hi>Flame</hi> is ſtill <hi>refining</hi> and ſtill <hi>encreaſing,</hi> ſome <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix-Men,</hi> who ſcorn to take a <hi>Woman</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their <hi>Arms,</hi> whom they can't admit into their <hi>Hearts</hi> too, and let them reign there without a <hi>Rival.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is not this betwixt <hi>different Sexes,</hi> and call you not this <hi>Friendſhip?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And tho I grant, conſidering what your <hi>Sex</hi> generally are, ours can hardly be too much affraid of you, ſince too many of you are like ſome Venemous Creatures, <hi>Blaſting</hi> all you <hi>Breath on,</hi> and tho fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Friendſhips</hi> of an extraordinary inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy after <hi>Marriage</hi> between different <hi>Sexes,</hi> not <hi>related,</hi> be, to ſpeak no worſe, very <hi>ſuſpitious</hi> and ill <hi>ſounding,</hi> and I agree with you, and <hi>fatal experience</hi> has put it beyond Contradiction, that there's no more <hi>ſpecious way</hi> to ruine then under ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; tho I ſay all this may be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet I can't ſee how it follows, that after <hi>Marriage</hi> we are to live like <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Wives, to be mew'd up and Impriſon'd all our <hi>Lives,</hi> and to <hi>dye</hi> if we but ſee any Man beſides our <hi>Husbands.</hi> Nor do I ſee any better reaſon, Why we ſhou'd ſhut our Eyes to their Merits, any more then their Perſons, why we mayn't put a <hi>modeſt value</hi> on thoſe who deſerve it, on a brave and good Man, more then on
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41990:92"/>one that's <hi>Villanous</hi> and <hi>Wicked,</hi> and this may at laſt amount to the Name of a <hi>General Friendſhip.</hi> The ſame we have for the <hi>Names</hi> of the great Men of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Ages,</hi> the ſame concern for them that we have, when we read the Hiſtory of <hi>Timoleon,</hi> or <hi>Brutus,</hi> or any of the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Heroes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, yet further, our <hi>own Affairs</hi> may often make it neceſſary to place a greater <hi>Confidence</hi> in one Man then another, and to entertain a more <hi>particular Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> with him, and yet all this far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough within the ſtricteſt bounds of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty</hi> and <hi>Virtue.</hi> We know not what you think of your ſelves, or how you feed on your own <hi>Vanity,</hi> but for our parts, we don't find you ſuch terrible Charming dangerous Creatures, that there's no caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Eyes on you, without ſtark fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Love with you. We are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of any ſuch thoughts; if you are ſo wicked, you had beſt keep from us, and make the Experiment whether we'll trouble you with our <hi>Invitations.</hi> Let us but alone, and we'll be bound not to <hi>raviſh</hi> you.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe a young Lady no ways en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd, ſhou'd be pleas'd with Honourable <hi>Addreſſes</hi> and <hi>Profers</hi> of <hi>Service,</hi> from a Perſon not unſuitable to her <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:</hi> Suppoſe ſhe contracted a <hi>real esteem,</hi> a particular tenderneſs for him, and were touched with his ſufferings and merits, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41990:93"/>ſhou'd be willing to make him all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns that a Man of Honour cou'd expect, or <hi>Virtue</hi> let her give. Where's the crime of all this, I'd fain know, or where the ſhame of it? Or what is there <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nnatural</hi> or <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral,</hi> or ſo much as <hi>undecent</hi> in it? Or who that is not <hi>Brutiſh</hi> wou'd condemn it, or not wiſh 'em happy?</p>
               <p>And if you find or think any thing worſe, if you have any thing that's ill in your own Breaſt, when you come near us, once more pray keep the Guilt, and ſhare the ſhame among your ſelves, and don't <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve</hi> the <hi>Innocent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, we believe <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> really as aimable as you can repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent 'em, and <hi>Friendſhip</hi> not much behind 'em: Nor are all your Sexes abuſe of thoſe excellent Names, and making 'em a <hi>covex</hi> for the worſt deſigns, make us out of Love with them, tho we ſhall endeavour to follow your adviſe, and to have a care of you.</p>

               <p>AND one wou'd think none ſhou'd ever pretend they were, nor will your <hi>Sex,</hi> I ſuppoſe, think themſelves much oblig'd by ſuch a Compliment, ſince the very thoughts of it muſt be as uneaſy to you, as hereafter is to the <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and will go near to <hi>ſowr</hi> all your <hi>mirth.</hi> If you wou'd be thought Religious, ſome ſay you muſt not <hi>Patch</hi> nor <hi>Paint,</hi> but all are agreed that you muſt not <hi>trick,</hi> nor <hi>diſſemble,</hi> nor <hi>lure</hi> in ſuch <hi>Flights</hi> of <hi>Lovers,</hi> nor admit a <hi>Gallant,</hi> nor abuſe your <hi>Husbands;</hi> and what a condition wou'd you be in, if all this ſhou'd be ſtruck off together? They tell a pleaſant ſtory of a <hi>Georgian</hi> Woman; who having liv'd ſuch a <hi>Life</hi> as is common enough with your Sex, and entertain'd a great many Friends, as was notoriouſly
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41990:94"/>known to all her Acquaintance; when ſhe was ſtopt in the midſt of her <hi>Career</hi> by a violent <hi>Fit</hi> of <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> ſent for her <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor</hi> for <hi>Ghoſtly Counſel,</hi> and promis'd faithfully ſhe wou'd live a chaſt Life, and forſake all her old Friends, if ever ſhe reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd: <q>No, ſays the <hi>conſcionable Father,</hi> that's too much to promiſe, and I know you'd never be able to perform it: I'd adviſe you therefore, he went on, to keep to <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> only, if you ſhou'd reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and this wou'd be a <hi>good ſtep</hi> to your <hi>thorough Amendment.</hi>
                  </q> Such Religion as this perhaps might do well enough with you, 'twou'd ſit much more <hi>jaunty</hi> and <hi>eaſy,</hi> and for that reaſon I wonder you are not all <hi>Catholicks,</hi> unleſs it be the fear of <hi>Hair-Cloth,</hi> and going <hi>Barefoot</hi> that keeps you from their <hi>Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who, you not <hi>Religions?</hi> Why, what ſigns of it wou'd we have? You go to <hi>Church</hi> as fine and as often, and clap the <hi>Pue-Door</hi> as hard, and repeat the <hi>Reſponſes</hi> as loud as any: You ſay your <hi>Prayers</hi> when it <hi>Thunders;</hi> and tremble at the ſight, or but the News of a <hi>Blazing Star,</hi> or a <hi>Cat</hi> with <hi>two Heads,</hi> or a <hi>Foal</hi> with a <hi>Top-knot,</hi> or a <hi>Whale</hi> rolling up the <hi>Thames,</hi> or any other <hi>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41990:94"/>as a <hi>New kindled Viper.</hi> As if in the firſt place you knew not how better to improve your Time, then to go to <hi>Church</hi> only out of <hi>pure Devotion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alas, you have great buſineſs there, which you think of greater moment: A <hi>Spark</hi> to meet, or a great many to ſtare at, till you grow giddy with turning round ſo often to throw kind looks at 'em, or ſquinting over your ſhoulder. Can you deny that this is the moſt uſual place of Aſſignations, or that ſuch thoughts as theſe are entertain'd and welcom'd, moſt of the time that you ſhou'd be better employ'd? 'Tis time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough you think, to be <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> when you grow <hi>old,</hi> when the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and pleaſures of youth are paſt, and you have no further reliſh for ſuch matters, and when the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Piety,</hi> and the <hi>London</hi> Diſpenſatory will be good Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for you, and for <hi>one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the mean time, any one may read your <hi>Devotion</hi> both in your <hi>Dreſs</hi> and your <hi>Eyes,</hi> your <hi>Looks</hi> and your <hi>Geſture,</hi> and your whole <hi>Behaviour,</hi> when you wou'd be thought in your <hi>greateſt Fits</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs:</hi> And 'tis not difficult to gueſs at the <hi>Deity</hi> you come thither to <hi>Worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you give not <hi>Billets</hi> about to your <hi>Lovers</hi> inſtead of <hi>Bills</hi> to the <hi>Reader,</hi> you have yet a well known way of diſcourſing with 'em: A <hi>Look</hi> upon one, a <hi>half-ſmile</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:41990:95"/>on another, a whole one to the third, a nod to the fourth, your <hi>Fine Teeth</hi> ſhow'd to the fifth, your <hi>Hand</hi> to the ſixth, a <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Glance</hi> to the ſeventh; And ſo on as many as will come, for you cou'd diſpatch 'em all, if there were a hundred.</p>
               <p>There may be, you'll perhaps reply, ſome vain <hi>young Creatures</hi> that employ themſelves after this manner; But no <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection</hi> on thoſe who do <hi>otherwiſe,</hi> whoſe behaviour is <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>ſcrious,</hi> and whoſe thoughts are fix'd on ſomething better then ſuch <hi>Foolleries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be it ſo then, and we'll take this excuſe as you have laid it; but firſt, you muſt ſhow one of theſe <hi>Saintlike Ladies,</hi> if never ſo little a pretender to <hi>Youth</hi> and <hi>Beauty,</hi> who won't leave all theſe grave thoughts, if ſhe ſees but a <hi>Spark</hi> ſhe likes, fixing his <hi>Eyes</hi> intently on hers, who will not be pleas'd with it, and return it, and ſplit Glances with him, and ſay, by your leave <hi>Devotion,</hi> on ſuch an occaſion?</p>
               <p>You do indeed come to <hi>Church,</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>Afternoons,</hi> as ſoon as you are <hi>Dreſt,</hi> when 'tis <hi>fair weather,</hi> when there's a <hi>Preacher</hi> you like, when 'tis not very hot, nor very cold, nor you han't a <hi>Cough,</hi> or like to be throng'd in your Seat, or Mr. <hi>Thimbleman's Wife</hi> does not ſit above ye, of you have no <hi>Viſitants</hi> at home, or no new <hi>Play,</hi> or <hi>Novel,</hi> or can't ſleep there as conveniently, or out of <hi>Complaiſance,</hi> or
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41990:95"/>becauſe all the Street beſides does it, or when you have an <hi>Aſſignation,</hi> or hopes of ſeeing one you like, or your next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours <hi>New Gown,</hi> or <hi>Triumphant Topping.</hi> Nay, to Judge the moſt Charitably, when you know there's <hi>fine Muſick,</hi> or a delicate <hi>Anthem.</hi> And if you can find any better Reaſons which bring the <hi>bigger half</hi> of your <hi>Sex</hi> thither, I'll freely own 'em all as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout as St. <hi>Katharine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing you have no buſineſs there, neither with <hi>Lads</hi> nor <hi>Laſſes,</hi> ſuppoſing your meaning as good, and <hi>Intention</hi> as <hi>pure</hi> as you'd deſire, nay, pick out the very beſt of your Sex, chuſe you <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> in every <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Town,</hi> and let us ſee how they'll behave themſelves. Their firſt work is certainly to throw their <hi>Eyes</hi> all round, to fiſh out their <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> and when once they find 'em, nothing but <hi>dopping</hi> and <hi>curtſying</hi> for a <hi>Quarter</hi> of an <hi>Hour.</hi> They are wonderful <hi>civil</hi> to all the <hi>Gueſts,</hi> only mythinks they'd do well not to <hi>forget</hi> the <hi>Maſter of the Houſe</hi> for altogether.</p>
               <p>Tho I can't tell how they ſhou'd do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, when if they happen to be <hi>awake,</hi> 'tis <hi>Chat</hi> and loud <hi>Whiſpers,</hi> and <hi>Laughter</hi> that keeps 'em ſo. They wou'd not be guilty of ſo rude a thing as to hearken to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> for a whole half hour, they are better bred then to mind what he ſays; They are not ſuch <hi>Fools</hi> as to need his <hi>Homilies.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:41990:96"/>
               <p>Well, when they have half <hi>chatted,</hi> and half <hi>nodded</hi> out the <hi>Sermon,</hi> and once get to the joyful <hi>Door</hi> again, you'll ſee more of their <hi>Religion</hi> in their abundant <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> and if they have any, here's indeed a very convenient place to <hi>ſhow</hi> it, in the worſt ſence of the word. The ſmall <hi>pence</hi> fly about, that you'd think it a <hi>Coronation,</hi> and there's at leaſt a <hi>brazen ſhower,</hi> if not a <hi>Silver one,</hi> among the poor thirſty <hi>Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers:</hi> But no more of this, leſt we ſhou'd diſcourage you from this little <hi>Kind</hi> of <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> which wou'd be a great deal better, if <hi>Vanity</hi> did not lie at the <hi>Core;</hi> a <hi>Worm</hi> which <hi>Cankers</hi> the <hi>fairest Fruit,</hi> and makes it good for nothing.</p>
               <p>'Tis a violent <hi>ſuſpicion</hi> that the <hi>Veſſel</hi> is very <hi>empty,</hi> which makes ſo loud a <hi>Noiſe:</hi> That all this <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Paint</hi> is to cover ſome great <hi>Deformity.</hi> Why ſo much <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade</hi> and <hi>Clutter,</hi> and <hi>Pretence,</hi> if all were right? <hi>Religion</hi> is <hi>modeſt,</hi> and <hi>Calm</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;</hi> It dwells retired in the deepeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the mind: It will, it's true, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times break out, and ſhine Gloriouſly, like the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Superſtitious</hi> you are, we muſt own, to the very heighth, and conſequently you wou'd have been <hi>Religious</hi> among the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> who uſe the <hi>ſame word</hi> to ſignify both. You made excellent <hi>Bacchanals,</hi> but I can't tell whether ſo good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. O!

Horrid Muſick</hi> indeed! But rarely well fitted to the <hi>Gods,</hi> and to the <hi>Worſhippers.</hi>

               <p>Some <hi>Crimes,</hi> it's true, you are not ſo frequently guilty of as our <hi>Sex,</hi> for which there are ſeveral <hi>Reaſons, Murders</hi> you need not Act your ſelves, for you have <hi>Bravo's</hi> enough to perform 'em without

               <p>For, as ſome of their Sex have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to perſwade ours, that we have no Souls, for a very Tranſparent Reaſon, ſo if others of 'em cou'd bring us to forget we had any Religion, they would then be on the Square with us, and would

               <p>Malice I ſee will pervert and poyſon the <hi>faireſt Action,</hi> nay, will contradict it ſelf rather then not blaſt the Reputation of its Neighbour.</p>

               <p>If we manifeſt any reſpect, or awful reverence at the extraordinary manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that Divine Power, which makes even <hi>Atheiſts</hi> tremble, why, 'tis nothing but <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Folly;</hi> if we are but civil to an Acquaintance at Church, at our firſt Entrance; for I never knew we were to put off Civility there, any more then any where elſe, this too muſt be view'd through falſe opticks: Our <hi>Charity</hi> it ſelf muſt be meer <hi>Oſtentation,</hi> as our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in rendring our ſelves at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick place of Worſhip, only to meet, or enſnare ſome of their <hi>Innocent Sex,</hi> who had no ſuch vain Imaginations. But he has one Accuſation, which I acknowledge <hi>lies heavier</hi> then all the reſt: That we go to Church to hear a <hi>fine Anthem:</hi> And if we went thither to Sing one, would there be any thing in it blameworthy? I expected the next Crime he would lay to our charge,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41990:98"/>wou'd be, that we went thither to <hi>ſay our Prayers.</hi>

               <p>Some there are, even of <hi>our Sex,</hi> whom you and I Madam have often obſerv'd, with grief and ſhame, who too often abuſe this ſacred place with Tattling and Laughter: Let the <hi>Satyr</hi> of our <hi>Antagonist</hi> fall as hard as he ſees convenient on ſuch as theſe, and let him, if he pleaſe, <hi>Whip</hi> 'em out of our Churches, like other <hi>Troubleſome Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;</hi> but then let him be ſure not to <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look</hi> any of his <hi>own Sex,</hi> who are guilty of the ſame Miſcarriage, and let him not unjuſtly blame thoſe who are free from it.</p>
               <p>We are all <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> there's no diſpute of it: <hi>Both Sexes</hi> are moulded of the ſame <hi>Clay,</hi> we do not pretend to be <hi>Angels,</hi> tho our Flatterers would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perſwade us ſo, in order to make us <hi>like themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they find our Weakneſs, why are they ſo ungenerous as to make us betray it? Why can they not deſiſt from temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us, even when we <hi>take Sanctuary</hi> to avoid them?</p>
               <p>But yet they cannot affirm without <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,</hi> that they find <hi>our Sex</hi> of ſuch I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-<hi>Constitutions;</hi> ſince they know many of their own, who have dogg'd a <hi>Lady</hi> to Church often enough, without ſeeing ſo much as her Face while they were there, at leaſt, if that could not be avoided, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41990:99"/>no Encouragement to their <hi>Amorous Follys,</hi> but all their <hi>Glances</hi> and <hi>Oglings</hi> loſt in the <hi>Air,</hi> like the Curſes they caſt on the <hi>Inſenſible fair Saint,</hi> for not returning them.</p>
               <p>As bad as we are in general, nay, as much deprav'd as the other Sex really is, I am not willing to believe ſo ill even of them, as this Gentleman would Inſinuate, only to blaſt us; not unlike the <hi>Envious Wretch</hi> that pull'd out one of his own <hi>Eyes,</hi> that his <hi>Neighbour</hi> might <hi>loſe both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He repreſents things indeed, in a more <hi>deplorable condition</hi> then I would hope they deſerve, our Churches, like thoſe in other Countreys, little better then <hi>Theatres,</hi> and the ſame Intrigues manag'd in both, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as they were of old, and as the <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Spy</hi> deſcribes ſome others, like the old Heatheniſh Temples of <hi>Cupid and Venus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pity thoſe who abuſe 'em ſhould ever <hi>enter</hi> 'em, unleſs there were more hopes of their <hi>Reformation</hi> by 'em. But I cannot think thoſe things are ſo common as he would have us believe.</p>
               <p>I declare, I have known but few ſuch Inſtances, and I never heard you, Madam, mention many more. It's poſſible that in five or ſix hundred, or a <hi>Thouſand People,</hi> there may be ſome few who make this the End of their coming thither. But what juſt reflexion can this be upon <hi>all the reſt,</hi> who may be as reaſonably charg'd with
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:41990:99"/>
                  <hi>Picking Pockets,</hi> becauſe it's Notorious that many wretches come conſtantly to Church with no other Intention.</p>
               <p>It's indubitably evident, that there may be <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> in frequenting the Publick Worſhip, but 'tis as certain, that in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caſes, there can be no <hi>Religion</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: Admit but this, which I do not fatter my ſelf in my own cauſe, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear very reaſonable, and it will be ſoon viſible, whether <hi>Sex</hi> has <hi>more Religion:</hi> The Gentleman, civilly remits us to the <hi>Seſſions Paper</hi> to make the Computation, but I muſt ask his pardon, if I cannot think that a <hi>fair way</hi> of <hi>Tryal.</hi> Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it true, which he Aſſerts, there may be many reaſons aſſign'd for it, without granting Women are the <hi>more wicked:</hi> For when Men have brought 'em into the <hi>Snares</hi> of the Law, they generally leave 'em, and can ſhift for themſelves <hi>well enough;</hi> beſides, there are ſome <hi>Capital faults</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Men cannot be guilty: And when they are Obnoxious to the Law, have many more Conveniences for making their Eſcapes, then a weak helpleſs Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: Theſe I take to be ſome of the reaſons, why we ſometimes find more Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Black Lift then Men, I ſay ſometimes, becauſe I know the contrary often happens.</p>
               <p>But now we have waited on our <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt</hi> to the Jayls, I hope he'll go with
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41990:100"/>us to Church, without ſuſpecting we have any deſign upon him by drawing him thither. We will not confine him to St. <hi>Brides</hi> neither, let him chuſe any Church in Town, and he'll eaſily ſee how far the <hi>Men</hi> are out-number'd by the <hi>Women,</hi> who without Compulſion fill thoſe Seats, which would be very empty without 'em.</p>
               <p>And I'm apt to believe, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his wrath againſt us, he does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally go to Church now and then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for he ſeems to have remember'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>pretty things</hi> about <hi>Religion,</hi> which we own, as well as he, ought to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally inward and ſilent; but yet if it be there, he knows it will work outward: Nor will he, I hope, affirm with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that there's no need of any <hi>publick Worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next <hi>bad thing</hi> he lays to our <hi>Charge</hi> is <hi>Superstition,</hi> wherein he is ſo civil to acknowledge we exceed the Men, altho not in true <hi>Religion:</hi> But he knows eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Virtue runs nearer one extream then the other, and he who is too <hi>Religious,</hi> too <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonably</hi> affraid of the <hi>Supreme Being,</hi> may yet in time have <hi>juſter Notions</hi> of him, while a <hi>deſperate Atheiſt</hi> is like to continue as he is, till another World <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> him. He cannot ſay, there are yet many of that <hi>Impious Sect</hi> amongſt us. He can Name no <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s, (he knows their <hi>Names</hi> better then we) nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41990:100"/>ſuch <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Poyſoners</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters</hi> of Mankind, of our Sex, altho we have had thoſe as Famous for many ſorts of Learning, as ever theirs could boaſt of: An Argument, by the way, that we are the ſounder <hi>Philoſophers</hi> too, becauſe it has been obſerv'd, that a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough and well digeſted <hi>Knowledge</hi> of things, inclines more to the belief of a <hi>Deity;</hi> whil'lt huddled, confus'd, and crude Notions, we ſee by experience, often ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Men <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> and <hi>Irreligious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gentleman owns we have not the ſame Temptations to <hi>Vice,</hi> wherewith his <hi>own Sex</hi> is Aſſaulted, and we wiſh we had leſs ſtill, as we ſhould have, were it not for them: However, in theſe caſes where we have no <hi>Tempter,</hi> let us be as frail as he can ſuppoſe us, we are not like to <hi>Err,</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> from <hi>Vice</hi> I take to be a good <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Virtue,</hi> and <hi>Innocence</hi> a good <hi>Foundation</hi> for <hi>Religion.</hi> They may diſcourſe while they pleaſe, of knowing the World, and the Advantages of Experience, we envy 'em not their dear bought knowledge, but think thoſe who know it leaſt, are both the ſafeſt and the happieſt.</p>
               <p>There is one paſſage more wherein he blames us, for our way of <hi>Educating Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> rendring their minds <hi>VVea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'TIS but a <hi>Cowardly</hi> ſort of <hi>Virtue,</hi> that's forc'd to wink, in order to avoid a <hi>Beautiful Enemy:</hi>— Nor will I ſo much as make uſe of your own <hi>Arms</hi> againſt you, that this <hi>Beauty</hi> that makes ſuch <hi>Aſhes</hi> of us all, is only in the Imagination:— Let it be in the Senſe too if it will, but I'm reſolv'd it ſhall never domineer over my Reaſon. Nay, I'll not only think it, but even look it into an <hi>Indifference,</hi> and the Subtleſt, the Lovelieſt, the Verieſt <hi>Woman</hi> of ye all ſhall no more debauch my <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> than one of your <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> cou'd the Perſon of that <hi>honeſt Philoſopher.</hi> You may ſay, if you think fit, as ſhe did, that I'm a <hi>Stone,</hi> and not a <hi>Man,</hi> but I'll prove my Reaſon beyond Contradiction, by deſpiſing ſuch <hi>Irrational Creatures</hi> as you are. Nay, never <hi>Dreſs,</hi> nor <hi>Patch,</hi> nor <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> nor <hi>Twire,</hi> nor <hi>Bruſtle</hi> up at me thus;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41990:102"/>for you'll all loſe your Labour. My Choice is made; and if I muſt have a Wife, I'm reſolv'd a good convenient Parcel of <hi>

               </p>
               <p>And a thouſand Conveniences ſhall I meet with by this honeſt <hi>Policy. First,</hi> I ſhall vex you, and mortifie your <hi>vain Sex</hi> a little, which will do me more Good than a Thouſand Guineas more in her Portion,— and it may be you may be the better for't too; at leaſt, 'twill be your own faults, if you be not: For there might be ſome Hopes of you, if we cou'd but once make you <hi>humble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But order you Matters as you pleaſe, for I'll ſtill go on with my Story.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I ſhall need no <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi> no Black or White <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> to keep that ſafe, which no Body but my ſelf will meddle with. Who wou'd diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet himſelf for the <hi>vain Satisfaction</hi> of having what's left of a <hi>Beauty,</hi> when he may be ſo much more happy, with one of a <hi>different Character.</hi> A thouſand Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Looks, and Bars, and Fathers and Husbands can't preſerve an <hi>Alemena,</hi> or a <hi>Danae:</hi> What Eternal Catterwawling there is about one of theſe <hi>Peſtilent Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> what purring o' one ſide, and ſcratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing o' t'other? How often a Man may have bin Skin-pinckt, for preſuming but to lead home his own <hi>natural Wife?</hi> With what
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:41990:102"/>Fear and Reverence muſt he Salute her How tenderly muſt he touch ſuch <hi>China Ware,</hi> and how ſlight a matter reduces it to its <hi>Primitive</hi> Earth again? Give me a good plain <hi>Earthen Platter,</hi> that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a ſound <hi>Bang,</hi> and while I eat in't, I'm ſafer from <hi>Poyſon,</hi> then if all my <hi>Meat</hi> were ſerv'd up in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorns Horns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>fine VVoman</hi> muſt be conceited, if ſhe has any <hi>Eyes,</hi> and conſequently be pleas'd her ſelf, that ſhe pleaſes others. Then ſhou'd I have a thouſand <hi>Fop-doodles, Primeing,</hi> and <hi>Cocking,</hi> and <hi>Dreſſing,</hi> and <hi>Singing</hi> at her, and Corrupting all my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and if by Miracle he ſhou'd at laſt, beyond my Expectation and his own, find her honeſt, he takes care to prefer her to one of the Boxes in the next <hi>Lampoon,</hi> or ſo publickly abuſe her, that I muſt be forc'd to ſlit his Windpipe, or he mine, in attempting her <hi>Vindication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, ſince our Honour is by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Civility of our Countrey, in our <hi>VVives keeping,</hi> I wou'd have my <hi>Cabinet</hi> made as plain and as ſtrong as poſſible, that none ſhou'd attempt to break it open, or if they did, might loſe their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>And as I ſhan't be troubled from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo neither from her ſelf. My <hi>Dear Joan</hi> and I ſhall agree well enough toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. She can't be Proud; for what has ſhe to be Proud of, except of my <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:41990:103"/>She can't be <hi>Ill-natur'd,</hi> for ſhe has nothing but the Agreeableneſs of her Temper to retain my <hi>Heart.</hi> Nay, ſhe can't be ſo much as Jealous, for ſhe ſhall know I choſe her before a <hi>Beauty,</hi> becauſe I liked her better. She'll be content with any thing, becauſe ſhe's humble, and Name me <hi>one Beauty</hi> that ever had that <hi>Virtue;</hi> ſhe'll not trouble me, or ruine me in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences.</hi> Not in Cloaths, becauſe ſhe ſhall be ſo ſuperlatively <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gly</hi> (if my kind <hi>Stars</hi> wou'd but ſend me ſuch a <hi>Jewel</hi>) that no <hi>Finery</hi> ſhall make her better. Nor in <hi>Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping,</hi> becauſe ſhe'll not care for much <hi>Company;</hi> nor in <hi>Journeys</hi> for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. She muſt Love me entirely, becauſe none elſe will Love her, and that muſt needs make me Love her again, and how ardently ſhall I embrace her <hi>Fair Soul,</hi> through her <hi>homely Body?</hi> And how quiet and happy ſhall we ſit at home, and pity the Miſerable <hi>Beauties,</hi> and thoſe who poſſeſs 'em, as <hi>Jove</hi> did <hi>Semele</hi> in the midſt of <hi>Storms</hi> and <hi>Thunder;</hi> while their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are <hi>Blaſted,</hi> their content Baniſh'd, their Eſtates Ruin'd, their <hi>Hearts</hi> Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and in a few Years, or perhaps Hours, that which was the occaſion of all this, is no more: The fatal cauſe is ceas'd, but the effects ſtill remain. The Beauty is gone, but the Woman ſtill Lives and Hangs on ye, and wou'd fain be a <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> ſtill, and when all the World is weary,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:41990:103"/>you muſt begin, and Cringe and Court as much as ever.</p>
               <p>Whilſt my dear <hi>Dowdy</hi> has ſuch a <hi>Face</hi> that ſhe defys Age, nay, Death it ſelf to hurt it. 'Tis as invulnerable as the heel of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and by the looks on't you'd think it had been dipt in the ſame Water. Time muſt have a good ſtomach if he meddles with't. It muſt be meerly for the ſake of Malice, and therefore I hope, he'll let her alone as well as all the reſt of Mankind: For my own uſe I'd have her, and what ſhou'd I care whether ſhe pleaſes others? ſhe'll be a Guard to my Houſe, her Face will fright Theves away, and my Children need no other <hi>Raw-head and Bloody-bones,</hi> to keep 'em in order. What pretty <hi>Cubbs</hi> they'll be, and how like their own dear <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother?</hi>

               <p>Who can think, or talk, or write tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porately when Beauty is the Subject: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could now be cold that had a Spark of Life, or motion.</p>
               <p>The pleaſure it gives is more refin'd and more remov'd from ſence, even then that of <hi>Muſick: Brute Creatures</hi> ſeem in ſome Inſtances to be mov'd by the latter, but only what has Reaſon by the former: That is too Spiritual a pleaſure for their inferior <hi>Natures.</hi> I can't therefore think they have Reaſon, becauſe they have no <hi>Choice</hi> in theſe matters: Their Appetites
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41990:106"/>hurry 'em on for the preſervation of their <hi>Kind,</hi> but Beauty never ſtrikes 'em, and the <hi>Herd</hi> knows no more <hi>Diſtinction</hi> then it does <hi>Propriety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if there ſhou'd be any <hi>Creatures</hi> in <hi>humane ſhape,</hi> who had the ſame <hi>Tempers</hi> and <hi>Inclinations,</hi> who could remain inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before ſuch an object as commands <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> and <hi>reſpect</hi> from the greateſt <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> they ought rather to be rankt with thoſe <hi>Inferior Animals,</hi> with whom they <hi>Sympathize,</hi> or at leaſt among the <hi>Mimicry</hi> and <hi>Sports</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> who may ſeem to have taken pleaſure in making a Figure ſo like a Man, which yet might puzzle the Philoſophers to deſcribe him, or to know what <hi>Species</hi> they ought to <hi>rank</hi> him under.</p>
               <p>Had Beauty only <hi>Barbarians</hi> to deal with, it would civilize 'em, had it the worſt of <hi>Men,</hi> ſo they are but <hi>Men,</hi> it might <hi>work</hi> upon them, refine the <hi>Oar,</hi> ſmooth the <hi>rugged'ſt Temper,</hi> cultivate the moſt barren ſoil, and every day produce <hi>New wonders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then it muſt keep company with Virtue, for if once that leaves it, how ſoon will it Pine and Languiſh? 'Tis like the Vine without the <hi>Elm,</hi> the <hi>Jeſſamine</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its <hi>Support.</hi> It tumbles to <hi>Earth,</hi> and is Trodden into the <hi>Mire,</hi> by every one that paſſes by it.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:41990:106"/>
               <p>The more difficulty there is in preſerving Beauty unblemiſht, the more glorious are thoſe who do ſo. It's poſſible to be done, for it has been, and ſtill is, in many inſtances. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is not ſo envious, or malicious as Earth, but can give Beauty and Virtue to the ſame Perſon, and they agree ſo well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, 'tis pity they ſhould ever be parted.</p>
               <p>It is the envy and wicked Revenge of diſappointed Wickedneſs, which often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſully what it cannot ruine; and the reſt of <hi>mankind</hi> is ſo <hi>ill-natur'd,</hi> and ſo very partial, that any of this Kind is greedily receiv'd and eaſily believ'd.</p>
               <p>Yet after all, if there are really ſo many ill Women in the World as ſome would perſwade us, who pretend to be very well acquainted with 'em, 'tis eaſily Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable, that Beauty is not the cauſe on't, nay, that the ſmaller part of thoſe who deſerve that Character are really Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe <hi>homely Faces</hi> make up the moſt of the World.</p>
               <p>And it is ſtill more likely, on ſome Accounts, that a fine Woman ſhou'd be Virtuous then one who is more indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, becauſe ſhe is naturally and juſtly conſcious of her own worth.</p>
               <p>There is a decent Pride, which will not let her have ſuch cheap thoughts of her ſelf as other People.</p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:41990:107"/>
               <p>If 'tis objected, that ſhe values her ſelf for it; and why ſhou'd ſhe not, ſo ſhe does it Soberly and Moderately? What Man is there who has more Strength, or Wealth, or Wit, or Prudence then his Neighbours, who does not find his mind Proportionably to his Endowments, and expect a juſt deference from ſuch as come behind him in any of thoſe <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beauty,</hi> 'tis true, decays, and ſo does every thing that's <hi>Mortal;</hi> but 'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be happy ſome part of <hi>Life,</hi> then none at all; and the <hi>Ruines</hi> of a <hi>good Face,</hi> muſt be better then thoſe of a bad one; Nay, more agreeable in Age, then the other, when it had the <hi>Freſheſt Youth</hi> to recommend it.</p>
               <p>Deformity ſtrikes the mind with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, as Beauty with Love: 'Tis, I confeſs, a deep Piece of <hi>Policy</hi> to Marry ſuch a Perſon as a Man cannot Love himſelf, for fear any body elſe ſhou'd Love her, Nor is he always ſo ſure of that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſince a miſhaped body oftentimes covers a more aukward and miſhapen mind. And Nature ſeems to cry, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware! whenever it ſhows us one of thoſe <hi>Antick Figures,</hi> and this they are ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of themſelves, that they are generally either negligent, and ſqualid of one ſide, becauſe indeed, they deſpair of pleaſing after all their pains, or elſe <hi>Spiteful</hi> and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41990:107"/>
                  <hi>Malicious Enemies</hi> to all the World, becauſe they think they have but few Friends in it. Nor has it been rarely found, that ſuch Perſons as theſe have been loſt in the <hi>loweſt degrees</hi> of the moſt fordid Vices, agreeable to their Nature and Inclination: Tho this muſt be own'd, in the laſt place, to prevent the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Ill-nature</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> that where ſuch as theſe apply themſelves vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly to the Proſecution of Virtue, they become as Famous as any, through a happy reſolution of mind.</p>
               <p>But yet on the other ſide, none can deny that Virtue looks much more Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a <hi>Beautiful Dreſs,</hi> then in one that's more indifferent or diſpleaſing.</p>

               <p>She's ſuch an <hi>Heterogeneous Creature</hi> as <hi>Africa</hi> ne're produced, for <hi>Nature</hi> will have her <hi>Fegaries</hi> too, now and then, in theſe <hi>colder Regions.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> have made it a Queſtion, whether there can be ſuch a thing as a <hi>Wit</hi> of the <hi>Breed</hi> of ſome Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: I think they'll allow it with much adoe, once or twice in an Age amongſt us <hi>Inſularies;</hi> not that we have any great reaſon to thank them for it, any more than thoſe who firſt tranſported other <hi>Wild-Beaſts</hi> into our Iſland. But above all the Forreſt, defend me from a <hi>She-wit,</hi> and a <hi>She-Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> tho' of the Two, I ſhould think the former the more <hi>terrible,</hi> and that I was ſcarce <hi>ſafe,</hi> tho' the <hi>wooden Bars</hi> in the <hi>Tower</hi> kept the <hi>Peace</hi> between us. Her <hi>Face</hi> I ſhou'd not much quarrel with, tho' generally cut out of the ſame <hi>piece</hi> with the <hi>He wit's,</hi> nor ſo much as her <hi>Tongue,</hi>

Beſides, ſhe's as dangerous at a diſtance, as at <hi>baudy-blows;</hi> ſhe's ſtuck round with <hi>Pens,</hi> as a <hi>Porcupine</hi> with <hi>Quills,</hi> and can dart 'em more ſpeedily and inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turkiſh Spy</hi> tells us of a <hi>rare Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> that cou'd ſhoot <hi>Twenty-five ſhot</hi> within the compaſs of a Penny, out of a little <hi>Pocket-Croſs-bow;</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> ſpoil'd his ſport, and got him <hi>aſſaſſinated,</hi> for fear of the worſt, and becauſe he might do 'em a miſchief. You <hi>She-wits</hi> will ſhoot faſter, and farther, and deeper, and make uſe of <hi>poyſon'd Arrows,</hi> and yet you live under ſo <hi>mild</hi> a <hi>Government,</hi> that it takes no care to <hi>prevent</hi> the <hi>miſchiefs</hi> you may occaſion, does not ſo much as make you find Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for your good <hi>Behaviour:</hi> However, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe not its <hi>Lenity,</hi> leſt it ſhould turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Fury,</hi> and at laſt order your Arms to be ſeiz'd, like thoſe of other dangerous and diſaffected Perſons.</p>
               <p>But if you have <hi>Beauty</hi> added to your <hi>Wit,</hi> the Poiſon is ſtill ſtronger, and the Infection more mortal; you fight then as unlawfully, as thoſe who wear Charms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; 'em; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There's indeed no touching one of thoſe ſort of Creatures, nor ſo much as ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſafely within ſight of you: It's as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous approaching you, as 'tis to diſturb a <hi>Painter</hi> when he's about ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary piece of Work; a Man muſt expect as ſoon as 'tis finiſhed, to ſee his Face on ſome Devil's Shoulders: He's ſure to fill a Gap in your next Lampoon, or furniſh a Character in your new Comedy; for if he gives way to the Stream, and lets you have all the Diſcourſe, he's a Dull Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and for that muſt be made an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; if he ventures to put in a word now and then, he's impertinent, and hinders you from pleaſing your ſelf, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Company with your agreeable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
               <p>But above all, woe to the Wretch that's in love with you, for his Torment is ſuch, that nothing can equal it. The <hi>Fantaſtick Devil</hi> will be ſure to <hi>will-o-the wiſp</hi> him
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:41990:109"/>about, till he's not able to ſtir, and it may be give him at laſt a dirty Ditch or Quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire to reſt in.

               <p>Now you are all <hi>Thunder,</hi> by and by nothing to be heard but <hi>gentle Murmurs;</hi> and preſently you are changed into <hi>Tehee</hi> and <hi>Laughter;</hi> but to be ſure your <hi>merry Humour</hi> comes when he's <hi>grave,</hi> and if the <hi>Lover's pleaſant,</hi> for that very reaſon you can once be ſilent.</p>
               <p>You'll wink upon his <hi>Rival</hi> before his <hi>Eyes,</hi> and yet he ſhan't dare <hi>complain,</hi> nay, not ſo much as <hi>ſigh,</hi> or look <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed,</hi> unleſs he'd eternally <hi>loſe</hi> you. And yet ſtill you find a way to twiſt your ſelves about his Heart again, that it ſhall neither be in his power to hate or forſake you, though he knows not how to love you. Away he flies, when you have provok'd him beyond meaſure, but you can lure him down again, ſtroke him and pleaſe him, make him ſhut his blew Broad Eyes, and ſleep in your <hi>Boſom.</hi>

               <p>And then if you do <hi>pinion</hi> him, when you have him at ſuch an advantage, whom can he blame but his own eaſineſs and folly?</p>

               <byline>By Madam <hi>GODFREY.</hi>

               <p>WHy ſo angry with <hi>Wit,</hi> Sir <hi>T.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what a <hi>Good Natur'd Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi> like your ſelf, replies to his <hi>Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt</hi> on ſuch an occaſion; you might have been made a <hi>Wit</hi> your ſelf, and ſhould you have taken it well, if others had
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41990:111"/>been ſo angry with you for no other <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ay—but 'tis the <hi>She-wits</hi> that you <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare War</hi> againſt; you are afraid of 'em, and yet you provoke 'em. You make 'em a parcel of <hi>Tygreſſes</hi> and <hi>Cata-mountains,</hi> and all the <hi>Monſters</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and yet as valiantly as your <hi>Brother Knight</hi> of the Ill-favour'd <hi>Countenance,</hi> go and ſet open their Cage, nay thruſt in a <hi>Staff,</hi> and make 'em cuff it about, without any fear of their ſallying out againſt you: And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, after all, you need not fear 'em: For have you not ſeen a harmleſs Familiar Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, walk about in the ſame Cage with the <hi>Lions,</hi> who yet have ſcorn'd to touch him, and thought him below their Anger? Nothing but Hunger cou'd ever drive 'em to lift up their Mighty Paw againſt him. Even ſo, Sir <hi>T.</hi> But ſo much for <hi>Similies,</hi> and now to the merits of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy between us.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, I always thought that <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> had poliſhed the <hi>Manners,</hi> and render'd all Perſons more refin'd, and more converſible; and that nothing was more fierce, or more untractable, than a <hi>Dunce</hi> or a <hi>Fool.</hi> But 'tis an Age of Paradoxes, Sir <hi>T.</hi> This that we live in, and you are born, I perceive, to do ſervice to Humane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and to ſet us right, and clear our Judgments from theſe and many other vulgar Errors. You aſſure us, that a <hi>Wit</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:41990:112"/>is the moſt fierce and moſt formidable Creature in the World: A thing with a long Tail, huge Horns, vaſt <hi>Glareing Baſon Eyes,</hi> unſufferable tremendous <hi>Claws,</hi> and a <hi>Tail,</hi> as long as a <hi>Blazing-Star,</hi> and as miſchievous as a <hi>Scorpion's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But is it not ſtrange that in <hi>Creatures</hi> of the ſame <hi>Species,</hi> there ſhould be ſo vaſt a difference? Why, there is not more between a tiney <hi>Newt,</hi> or a harmleſs little <hi>Lizzard,</hi> and your vaſt and terrible <hi>Crocodiles,</hi> or <hi>Alligadors,</hi> then between a <hi>Hee,</hi> and a <hi>Shee-Wit,</hi> according to your way of deſcribing the one, and what we know of the other. Since your <hi>Hee-Wits,</hi> Sir <hi>T.</hi> by all that we cou'd ever obſerve, and as you know by experience, are often the gentleſt tameſt Creatures, that we Ladys are no more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of, then of our <hi>Squirrils:</hi> We have 'em in a <hi>Chain,</hi> they fling themſelves about from one place to t'other, are never at reſt, but always good humour'd and diverting, and give 'em but a handful of <hi>Filberts,</hi> you ſhall have 'em the beſt Company in the World. Tho theſe, I confeſs, are only the <hi>Tame-Wits</hi> of whom I'm diſcourſing, and are among whom our Acquaintance chiefly lies; Thoſe who are reſin'd and poliſh'd by their Converſation with the <hi>Fairer Sex,</hi> whoſe company you muſt own, exceeds the beſt Academys in theſe matters, ſince for thoſe of ye who run wild, and only herd with one another, how
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:41990:112"/>ſhould you but retain your <hi>Native Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and yet certainly you might be tamed too, with our <hi>good management,</hi> unleſs you are worſe then <hi>Elephants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You are affraid of our Painting; Sir <hi>T.</hi> and leſt you ſhou'd ſee your own ſweet Face expos'd by ſome of our Pencils more to the Life then you'd deſire: But yet a wiſe Man wou'd not be too much affraid of a diſtant and only <hi>poſſible danger:</hi> Beſides, there are ſome Faces ſo very hard to hit, ſo full of ſo many <hi>pretty oddneſſes,</hi> and <hi>particularities,</hi> and ſo very <hi>Jeneſceay-quoyiſh,</hi> that a <hi>Good Artiſt</hi> would hardly venture his Reputatition in attempting 'em. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhou'd we ever venture to draw it, we promiſe you we won'not be ſo Malitious as to put a Tail to't.</p>
               <p>But you ſay, 'tis ill truſting ſuch <hi>Edge-Tools,</hi> as wit in our Hands. I confeſs, Sir, you have reaſon, for if we once knew how to uſe 'em, we ſhould ſoon beat ye at your <hi>own Weapons;</hi> at <hi>Mother-Wit,</hi> you own we outdo ye already; and who can blame you for endeavouring to keep us from impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, ſince we ſhould then be doubly your <hi>Maſters?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It were but fair tho, after after all theſe quarrels about Wit, that you would be ſo kind to tell us what it is, leſt we ſhou'd diſpute, and you ſhould blame us for what yet never had a real being.</p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:41990:113"/>
               <p>If it be, a <hi>juſt Imaging of Nature,</hi> why may not our Sex attempt it as well as yours, and what inconvenience could follow, ſhould they ſucceed in't, and why may not they do it <hi>Maſterly</hi> as well as <hi>Bungling?</hi> Succeſs in theſe things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending partly upon Obſervation, and partly on cuſtom, but chiefly on a lively Imagination and a <hi>happy Genius.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it's in this quickneſs of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, wherein Wit may be thought Principally to conſiſt, according to the moſt uſual acceptation of the word, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho, if conſider'd to the bottom, it may be this <hi>Definition</hi> would be found to fall in with the former. However, all are agreed, that Readineſs of Thought, and Sharpneſs of Repartee, are great Inſtances of Wit, and that in ſuch <hi>Lucky turns</hi> we may ſee the livelieſt Glances of it. And if in theſe you will not pretend to come near us, what is there in them, I beſeech you to tell us, for which you can juſtly blame us? Theſe things are Diverting, and Surprizing, and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and for which you value your ſelves very highly, and you pretend you are fond of 'em too in us, when you can find 'em.</p>
               <p>That Wit, in Woman found ſo rare as one of your own <hi>aſſuming Sex</hi> deſcribes it, and yet when you have found it, you are always envying and pecking at it; Neither
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:41990:113"/>
                  <hi>Folly</hi> nor <hi>Wit</hi> in our <hi>Sex</hi> will pleaſe ye, and yet you have <hi>Indifference</hi> as much as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But our next Accuſation is for <hi>Poetry,</hi> another <hi>Mortal Sin,</hi> which no <hi>Indulgence</hi> from your <hi>Infallibilities,</hi> it ſeems, muſt <hi>Pardon.</hi>

How many Lives have been ſacrific'd to that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiate Fiend,</hi> a <hi>Female Jealouſy,</hi> and what <hi>Hecatombs</hi> wou'd be ſufficient to <hi>appeaſe</hi> it!

               <p>Even Night it ſelf, the <hi>Eaſer</hi> of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cares, brings no benefit to the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wretch that's haunted with ſuch a <hi>Domeſtick Fieud:</hi> What makes up all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Breaches</hi> only widens theirs: The <hi>Sun</hi> may ſet and riſe, and ſet again, but ſhe's no Changeling: The <hi>Bed's</hi> her <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> and ſhe ſays her Prayers there, but 'tis as <hi>Witches</hi> do, all backward.</p>
               <p>She has an admirable <hi>Memory,</hi> that's the Truth on't, and ſhall run ye back ten, or
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:41990:116"/>twenty years, and give the poor Man as exact a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of all his <hi>Sins,</hi> as if ſhe had been his <hi>Evil Genius,</hi> that tempted him to commit 'em.

She's ſuch a deepſighted Polititian, that, with her, whatever may be, always is; ſhe

               </p>
               <p>Nay, ſhe's Jealous even of her ſelf, leſt he ſhou'd think of others while he's em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing her, and not content of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him in this World, wou'd fain carry her cruelty even beyond the Grave. She's Mortally affraid of dying firſt, leſt he ſhou'd Marry again, ſhe thinks <hi>Second Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages</hi> but another ſort of Adultery, and abſolutely unlawful, and if any thing cou'd make her content to leave him, 'twou'd be the hopes of <hi>haunting</hi> him in the time of his <hi>Second Wife,</hi> drawing the <hi>Curtains,</hi> glaring in upon 'em, pulling off the Cloaths from 'em, and ſliding in cold between 'em. And earneſtly wiſhes for the Enchanted <hi>Ring</hi> they talk of, which made one of the <hi>French</hi> Kings ſo mad for his <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> and doat upon her very Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs.</p>

                  <hi>Anſwer to</hi> Letter XX. <hi>Concerning Jealouſy in Women.</hi>
               </head>
               <byline>By Madam <hi>BRIGGINSHAW.</hi>
               </byline>
               <p>YOU muſt own <hi>Jealouſy</hi> is ſometimes a <hi>Sign</hi> of <hi>Love;</hi> you ſo often give us reaſon to be <hi>Jealouſe,</hi> there is not a Creature in the World more <hi>Jealouſe</hi> then a <hi>Husband,</hi> and yet you run on in the <hi>Old Track,</hi> load us with all the <hi>odium</hi> you can rake together, and would have us believe <hi>your Sex</hi> is perfectly innocent.</p>
               <p>Why ſhould a Wife ever concern her ſelf at what her Husband did, had ſhe not an extraordinary tenderneſs for him? And does ſhe not deſerve better returns then ſhe generally meets with, for enduring ſo painful a Paſſion only on his Account, whereas if ſhe never Lov'd him, ſhe would know nothing of it?</p>
               <p>You are all ready enough to blame our Sex, whether with, or without Reaſon, and to exclaim againſt 'em, if they manifeſt the leaſt Reſentment in caſes of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:41990:117"/>You would have us be all ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Grizzles</hi> as the Woman that <hi>Lucy</hi> talks of, who furniſhf a Chamber for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands <hi>Conveniencies:</hi> But you cannot think it ſo very eaſy for a <hi>Woman</hi> of <hi>Spirit</hi> to digeſt an affront of ſo high a Nature: We do not care for being ſlighted any more then you, we think we deſerve <hi>Love,</hi> and may reaſonably expect it: But when after the moſt <hi>Solemn Vows,</hi> the moſt paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate and private <hi>Oaths,</hi> and publick <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities,</hi> a <hi>Fine Woman</hi> ſhall be left in a few Months, it may be, for ſome contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſeaſe, or at leaſt common and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary <hi>Creature;</hi> this would provoke any thing that is not <hi>all a Saint,</hi> which <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> not very many; either of us or you can pretend to: And no other Reaſon given for this Treatment but, ſhe's a <hi>Wife,</hi> with a <hi>Curſe</hi> at one end on't. And how common this is at preſent, how difficult to find any of your Sex who are Maſters of any more fidelity or honeſty, all the <hi>Surgeons</hi> in Town can Witneſs, as well as the unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome dwindling Remains of many conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Families. I can ſcarce forbear Naming ſome of 'em, did not decency for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it: There are <hi>few Letters</hi> in the <hi>Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet</hi> that wou'd not point at one or other.</p>
               <p>There's my Lord, <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> and Sir <hi>E. F.</hi> and <hi>G. H.</hi> and <hi>J. K.</hi> and <hi>L. M. N.</hi> and Sir <hi>O. P.</hi> and Squire <hi>Q. R.</hi> tho I think there's but one of that Name, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:41990:118"/>even Mr. <hi>S. T.</hi> and <hi>V. W.</hi> and I might go on at the ſame rate were there a <hi>Hundred Letters</hi> in the Alphabet, or ſhould I repeat it an hundred times over, or <hi>Ring</hi> as many <hi>Changes</hi> upon't as one may upon <hi>Four</hi> and <hi>Twenty Bells.</hi> And while mankind is ſo Univerſally falſe, whether would you think it a piece of <hi>Charity,</hi> or <hi>Folly</hi> in a Woman never to ſuſpect, Nay, not to believe her Eyes, when the Baſeneſs and Villany of your Sex appears ſo Glaringly before 'em? It is not indeed, properly <hi>Jealouſy</hi> or <hi>Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but certainty and demonſtration, when matters are once brought to this paſs: But you'll ſay, ſuppoſe an Husband has been once falſe, he may be better, and we ought to hope better of him: Why truly, I know no <hi>abſolute Impoſſibility</hi> in the <hi>Repentance</hi> of the <hi>Devils</hi> themſelves, but yet I'm ſure they are fallen; and have not ſo large a <hi>Charity</hi> for them, as I have heard one of the Fathers had, who fully believ'd they ſhould be <hi>ſav'd:</hi> It is not often that Men <hi>repent,</hi> when arriv'd to any heigth of <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs:</hi> They ſhould have ſtopt ſhort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had got ſo far; when they are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, they muſt needs be down, and who can undo what is <hi>once done</hi> in ſuch caſes? or how can we help <hi>Remembring</hi> the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> when we have the <hi>Traitor</hi> always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Eyes? When it is your own Caſe, you plead that the Marriage is effectually diſſolv'd by any <hi>one Act,</hi> on the Womans
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:41990:118"/>ſide of this <hi>Nature.</hi> But pray how many muſt go to it on the <hi>Mans?</hi> Or if one were ſufficient, how few <hi>Marriages</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main undiſſolv'd? It is indeed this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and the kindneſs we have to our <hi>Families,</hi> and the order of the World, and even to our <hi>Falſe</hi> and <hi>Tyrannical Maſters,</hi> which inclines us to put up more <hi>Affronts</hi> of this <hi>Nature,</hi> then it were poſſible for us to digeſt, were we not more <hi>unpaſſionate</hi> and more capable of Reaſon then you general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſent us; Eſpecially when you have ſo far ſuborn'd cuſtom to your ſide, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable a <hi>Tyrant</hi> as your ſelves, that it has paſt it into one of its own unequal Laws, that it is the <hi>Duty</hi> of a <hi>Woman</hi> to be all <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Butter,</hi> all <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> and <hi>ſoftneſs,</hi> when her Husband keeps a Brace, or a <hi>Leaſh</hi> of <hi>Rampant Whores</hi> under her <hi>Noſe,</hi> it may be in the very Houſe, and maintain'd by her <hi>Fortune,</hi> to bring Begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Diſeaſes into the Family: Whereas when a Gentleman is but ſeen near a <hi>VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Apartment,</hi> if he dares but peep into the <hi>Avenues</hi> of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> immediately nothing's to be heard but <hi>Piſtols</hi> and <hi>Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> and <hi>Divorces</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and all the <hi>terrible</hi> things in <hi>Nature.</hi> Now altho you are pleas'd for ſome <hi>Politick Reaſons,</hi> to give your ſelves ſo great an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,</hi> without any regard to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Sex, or the <hi>Temptations</hi> of your own, or <hi>Generoſity,</hi> or ſo much as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:41990:119"/>Juſtice; yet you might permit us ſtill to keep that <hi>little Portion</hi> of <hi>Common Sence,</hi> which <hi>Nature</hi> has given us, and tho we have ſo little means to right our ſelves, give us leave to know when we are injur'd, and to be uneaſy under the <hi>Injuſtice.</hi> For ſuppoſe us, for once, to have all the <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> which you think we want, yet one ſuch wound, one <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Infidelity,</hi> if it ſhould not be <hi>Mortal</hi> to our Love, muſt yet needs leave a deep and a laſting Scar behind it. Such too well grounded <hi>Suſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> with ſuch <hi>Ruinous matter of Fact</hi> to <hi>ſupport</hi> 'em, as you can never blame us for 'em, unleſs you do the ſame for having Eyes, or for thinking, and making uſe of our <hi>Reflection</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot deny but we know we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the better, for all the diſcoveries we make of this Nature, nay, that it would be on ſome Accounts the wiſer way to reſt our ſelves content in ignorance, rather then by enquiring into your <hi>Infidelitys,</hi> to have only a miſerable choice left us, either to be <hi>diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi> in our <hi>ſearch</hi> by your deeper cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſo loſe all our expence and time, or it we find what we expect, to give our ſelves the moſt ſenſible <hi>Affliction</hi> and <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> Yet on the other ſide, you muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that <hi>ſuſpence</hi> is one of the moſt <hi>uneaſy conditions</hi> of Life, and you can hardly with Juſtice blame us if we deſire to get out of it, and to know the worſt, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it coſts us. <hi>LYDIAH BIGGINSHAVV.</hi>

               <byline>By <hi>Mr. AXTEL—</hi>
               </byline>
               <p>I don't mean that ſhe <hi>ought</hi> not to be <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,</hi> but that if ſhe be, ſhe'll be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the better for't, and that ſhe's ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummately perverſe, that there's no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way to work upon her. A <hi>Tyger</hi> may be <hi>tam'd,</hi> a <hi>Lion</hi> may have his <hi>Teeth</hi> knockt out, and <hi>Claws</hi> pared, and any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of <hi>Viper</hi> its <hi>Sting</hi> pulled out; but do all this to a <hi>Woman,</hi> ſhe'll be a meer <hi>Woman</hi> ſtill: If you knock out her <hi>Teeth,</hi> ſhe'll mumble you with her implacable <hi>Gums;</hi> nay, if you pull out her <hi>Tongue,</hi> ſhe'll certainly ſcold with the <hi>ſtump</hi> on't, while the leaſt <hi>bit</hi> is left. A <hi>Ducking Stool</hi> is but a ſort of <hi>Chair of State</hi> with 'em, when enthron'd there, they are at the top of their Preferment: The Water is ſo far from cooling a ſeaſon'd Scold, that ſhe is more likely to heat the Water; ſhe ſizzes
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:41990:120"/>as ſhe goes down, and makes it at leaſt Summer about her. She's like <hi>Achilles</hi> dipt in <hi>Styx,</hi> perfectly invulnerable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts as much additional <hi>hardneſs</hi> as <hi>Steel,</hi> by being quench'd in <hi>Water.</hi> The whole Sex are akin to the <hi>Taylor</hi>'s <hi>Wife,</hi> they'll be ſnapping their Fingers as ſoon as they riſe, ſink 'em as deep as ye will; and when you ſee an <hi>Anvile</hi> the ſofter for being ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer'd every Day, you may hope the ſame good effect from diſciplining a <hi>Woman,</hi> whoſe <hi>depraved Stomach</hi> turns not only Food, but wholeſome Phyſick into the rankeſt Poyſon.</p>
               <p>Were I to direct a <hi>Painter</hi> to draw the <hi>Labour in vain,</hi> he ſhould throw aſide the old Story of <hi>Lathering</hi> the <hi>Blackmoor,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of it, ſhould paint the <hi>Taming of the Shrew,</hi> which is ſcarce probable enough to make a <hi>Play</hi> of it, becauſe none can affirm 'tis a true <hi>Image of Life.</hi> An <hi>Opera</hi> indeed might be made on't, ſuch another buſineſs as the <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> but the Characters would be as incredible, and much ſtranger than the <hi>two Cubbs</hi> begot by an <hi>Incubus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There's a dark ſullenneſs, a black rooted obſtinacy in all the Sex, the ſame keen ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs that we find in the Blacks, and tho' ye ſhould cut the <hi>Snakes</hi> all to pieces, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very little bit of 'em would fly in your Face.</p>
               <p>Well, will <hi>fair means</hi> do any better with 'em? will <hi>kindneſs</hi> and <hi>lenity</hi> work on their
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:41990:120"/>
                  <hi>good Natures?</hi> Yes, juſt as much as 'twill upon a <hi>Wolfs,</hi> whom ye have ſaved from the Tree, and brought home to make a Houſe Dog of him: Have at your <hi>Mutton,</hi> if he can any ways get a fling at it, and if he once breaks looſe, he's ten times worſe than ever.</p>
               <p>Whoever knew a <hi>Woman</hi> the better for being kindly us'd? No, 'tis your Duty, you ought to do no leſs; nay, you dare do no otherwiſe, and who ſhould thank you only for paying them their own?</p>
               <p>This 'tis to be ſo very well opinion'd of themſelves, they have ſuch an abundant ſtock of <hi>Conceit,</hi> that they merit more than all; they are out of reach of <hi>Civility,</hi> and 'tis impoſſible to oblige them.</p>
               <p>It ſhows indeed the Generoſity of their Temper, that the more they are lov'd, the more ſtill they inſult. They have then a Handle, an Excuſe for domineering, the couchant Husband or Lover muſt bid Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel to the Reins and Saddle, know his diſtance, and learn obedience.</p>
               <p>But your Patience ſhall prevail as little as your Love: Who would not tread upon a Footſtool? And the more you have born already, the more you are like to bear, as you are the better able. Your Brains lie in your Shoulders, for there is all your Wiſdom.

An Honeſt Shrew there's as little hopes of, as of a Preciſe Hypocrite. They ſtand upon their Honour, and are both ſo good, you know not how to mend 'em; and they neither envy the World the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their Virtues, for you never need fear but you ſhall hear of 'em. <q>Ah— did I ſerve you as other Women do their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and keep a brace or two o'Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands under your Noſe, I ſhou'd not be us'd thus.

The Surface is a little varied, but the unfathomable bottom is ſtill the ſame, the Water as ſalt and bitter as ever, and the Waves as dangerous and unconſtant.

               <p>SEvere Cenſures indeed! that will not ſo much as give us leave to mend, after you have reckon'd up all the Faults we are guilty of, and a Thouſand more, which never enter'd into our Minds. I confeſs I thought all Creatures that were indu'd with Reaſon, were by that Faculty alſo capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to review their Actions, and where they had formerly done amiſs, to do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Nay, I have obſerved even Creatures without Reaſon, will travel more careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they come to a Place where they have formerly ſtumbled, or bin in danger: But have we leſs <hi>Senſe</hi> even than what is <hi>Irrational?</hi> or will you not allow us ſo much as that ſhadow of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which all give to Beaſts themſelves? or muſt a <hi>true Wife,</hi> as you call her, be neceſſarily of the ſame
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:41990:123"/>Temper with a <hi>true Husband,</hi> rather to go on and break her Neck, than acknowledge ſhe was miſtaken in the Road, and ask the Direction of her Fellow Travellers? Thus far indeed I muſt confeſs, that ſome Perſons have ſuch a way of Teaching, that they plainly confeſs they have no mind any ſhould learn ought from them, eſpecially if the Scholar's of a free and ingenuous Temper. You never knew a Bird taught to ſing, when you held him by the Throat, and the poor little Creature was juſt ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for Life. Let us at leaſt hop about our Cage, if you'll not allow us an <hi>Avia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> This may in time bring us off from our wild Notes, and make us ſing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you pleaſe: Unleſs you expect we ſhould ſay that <hi>white's black,</hi> and pay you ſuch an Obedience, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> requires of her Votaries: But were it not more deſirable to have a Reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in your Boſom, than one whom you had render'd perfectly ſtupid, without any Choice or Will? And can you deny that we are obliged in ſome Caſes to diſobey you? which we can never do, though you ſhould command us to perperrate the greateſt Crimes, or to endure the worſt of Villanies, if you have once taken away that Reaſon which muſt be the guide of all our Actions.</p>

               <p>A generous Nature is eaſily to be wrought upon, if you go about it the right way; but Force is only a fit Argument for a Beaſt or a <hi>Slave;</hi> and if you make uſe of it on thoſe who have the ſame Principle of Reaſoning with your ſelves, you may perhaps make 'em fear ye, but it is certain they will never love ye: Nay, even that Fear will by degrees wear away, ſince it is very natural to ſlight frequent and unreaſonable Anger, which like any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Correction manag'd at the ſame rate may harden, but not amend us. Now why ſhould not you Men, who fancy your ſelves indu'd with ſuch a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererrogation of Prudence, make choice of ſuch means as would infallibly attain the ends you propoſe, rather than ſuch as you know would effect the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? eſpecially when thoſe Methods are more pleaſing and eaſie to you, as well as us? You ſay you would fain have us better, and reform ſome Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Follies whereof you think us guilty: If you are in earneſt, and had not rather have us continue faulty, on purpoſe that you may have the pleaſure of finding fault with us, learn for once from a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man how to deal with Women, for we ſhould be beſt acquainted with our ſelves.</p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:41990:124"/>
               <p>And in the firſt place, we don't deſire to be thought full out ſuch Angels as you repreſented us for your own Ends, at your firſt Acquaintance. How can you expect to have us make good what you your ſelves did never believe, tho' you have often enough ſaid and ſworn it, in the heat of Courtſhip? Set off all thoſe heightnings, allow for 'em all when you come nearer. You take us at laſt for <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for worſe,</hi> as we do you, Perſon, and Portion, and Faults, and all together; and as you would hardly refuſe or throw back a good Portion for one Braſs Half-Crown in't, you ſhould, we would hope, allow us as fair Play as you do our adorable Bags; take good and bad in a Lump; at leaſt overlook the one, if but tolerable and inconſiderable, for the ſake of the other. In ſhort, little Faults, in ſome caſes, can hardly be taken notice of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a greater, eſpecially if ſeverely inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, and unconſcionably aggravated, and never forgotten; which muſt needs by degrees ſower our Minds; and were they not generally more confirm'd in Patience and other Vertues than your Sex, which gives 'em ſufficient occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe 'em, would be apt to throw 'em in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worſt Extravagancies.</p>
               <p>But if your Example and Converſation ſhould incline us to greater Faults, yet why may not we amend, as we have
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:41990:125"/>known ſome of your ſelves, when there has been but little hopes of you? A calm, a kind, a ſeaſonable and rational repreſenting our Errors, with the ill-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of 'em, can hardly miſs Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. But when did you know a Furious Reproof work any good effect; or how ſhou'd it, when the Reprover himſelf, as he manages, is guilty of, it may be, as great a fault as thoſe againſt whom he exclaims with ſo much bitterneſs, and ſo little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion? A harſh Reproof is like cold Water thrown on a Bed of <hi>Salla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 'tis newly ſown; it hardens the Earth, and ſtarves the Seed: But one that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Kindneſs and Concern with it, is like warm Water; it enters kindly, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes the little ſprouting Principles of Life, ſoftens the Earth, and brings a plentiful Crop, to recompence the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner's Induſtry and Labour. Violence, and Noiſe, and Eagerneſs, have ſo little of Reaſon in themſelves, that they ever diſcredit the beſt Reaſon, and for the moſt part render it unprofitable, when it lights into ſuch bad Company. It looks like an Abuſe, and an Attack, rather than a Kindneſs, and we are apt to be upon our Guard in ſuch Caſes, to keep the Gate ſhut, and even exclude a Friend, for fear of admitting an Enemy.</p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:41990:125"/>
               <p>Eſpecially when all this is done in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, for every little Fault, and often none at all, in the more provoking and aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner, beyond the patience even of a Woman to ſuffer it.</p>
               <p>VVherefore would you be at the pains to uſe the quite contrary Methods, would you obſerve our Tempers and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and work us accordingly, and bend us by degrees, and take time and pains about us, you might bring us to take whatever Ply you deſire, and make your own Lives and ours, much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier.</p>

               </byline>
               <p>YES, here you're in your <hi>Element,</hi> and 'twou'd be a more difficult matter to make you renounce Plays, then to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and you like 'em the better for what <hi>Pryn</hi> tells you of 'em, that they were formerly expreſsly reckon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Pomps</hi> and <hi>Vanities</hi> of the <hi>World;</hi> nor will it much move you, that <hi>Satan</hi> and they were us'd to ſtand and fall together. The <hi>Play-houſe</hi> is your <hi>Church,</hi> and you had much rather be <hi>Excommunicated</hi> from dear St. <hi>Brides</hi> it ſelf, then from that yet more convenient place of <hi>Aſſignation.</hi> Here you Learn all that you think is neceſſary for your Sex to know, and yet more, ſee it put in practice at leaſt, if you don't juſt then do it your ſelves. To diſobey your <hi>Parents, diſoblige</hi> your <hi>Friends, ogle,</hi> and then <hi>bilk</hi> your <hi>Lover, cheat</hi> your <hi>Husband,</hi> talk pertly and lewdly, and laugh at all that's graver and better then your ſelves.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:41990:126"/>This is the rare <hi>Academy</hi> to form your minds, or rather to ruine 'em, and often your Eſtates and Bodys with 'em. How many <hi>Modern Plays</hi> can you ſhow me without a more then <hi>moderate ſhare</hi> of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety</hi> and <hi>Lewdueſs.</hi> The beſt are patterns of <hi>Revenge</hi> and <hi>Fooliſh Love,</hi> that eithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> weaken the mind or miſlead it: The moſt I'm ſure are ſo unfit for any <hi>civiliz'd Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi> that I've often wondred how any of your Sex, who are not Profeſs'd—could have Impudence to ſit 'em out, or read 'em, or their Authors to ſet their Names to 'em: For them indeed, they have an excuſe, which you beſt know the Truth of, that the Stage is an Image of Life, and that they only repreſent things as they find 'em, and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men juſt what they are; which if true, is very much for your Sexes and the preſent Ages <hi>Reputation.</hi> For your ſelves, they have either taught you the way, or you have Learnt it from Mother Nature, to ſet out as <hi>fulſom ſtuff</hi> as <hi>N. Lees,</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Cleve,</hi> without <hi>Bluſhing.</hi> You don't under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, pretty <hi>Innocents!</hi> No more then a Viper does Poiſon, which is his <hi>daily Food,</hi> and almoſt the Air he breaths; for there's a great <hi>harmony,</hi> it ſeems, between <hi>Sabina's ſences</hi> and your <hi>underſtandings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe, for once, there cou'd a <hi>modeſt play</hi> be found, I mean in the <hi>Expreſſions,</hi> what are we the better if the whole <hi>Action,</hi> as it generally happens, inſinuates nothing
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:41990:127"/>but <hi>looſeneſs</hi> and <hi>lewdneſs?</hi> Are you all ſuch <hi>Veſtals</hi> to be proof againſt the <hi>Allurements</hi> of <hi>Muſick,</hi> and the more fatal <hi>Witchcraft</hi> of <hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>Example,</hi> when it may be at the ſame time a <hi>Bevy</hi> of <hi>Fops</hi> hang about your <hi>Ears,</hi> (as <hi>Milton</hi> ſays, the old Traitor did at <hi>Eves,</hi> tho in a little more proper ſhape,) and prodigally <hi>ſquander</hi> their <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Souls,</hi> and all, ſtriving who ſhall damn theirs faſteſt to perſwade you to damn yours.</p>
               <p>Not that I'd ſcandalize 'em with being <hi>always witty</hi> neither: No, they ſeldom offend againſt that rule of Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> and are well enough pleas'd with following his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; Rather then all be wit, let none be there. For I'm apt to believe the greateſt part of their <hi>Converſation</hi> is juſt ſuch as pleaſes you, and ſuch as you're capable of, as dull as you cou'd hear in e're a <hi>Countrey Church</hi> in <hi>Christendom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But your wiſe diſcourſe has carry'd me off from the <hi>Play;</hi> which is the only good it does in the <hi>Theatre,</hi> where your chat can hardly be worſe then the Actors, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lowder the better.</p>
               <p>How often is't you there ſee Virtue proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, and vice unhappy? So far from it that the <hi>Play-wrights</hi> tell you now poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 'tis none of their <hi>buſineſs</hi> to make 'em ſo. They have got <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> they make their own <hi>Rules,</hi> and you muſt take their <hi>Herces</hi> as you find 'em.</p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:41990:127"/>
               <p>Or if they do now and then kill a <hi>Don John,</hi> or a <hi>Maximinian,</hi> to <hi>thin</hi> the <hi>Stage</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and turn off ſome <hi>over-grown Villain,</hi> they yet generally take a particular care not to let him repent; they kill him while he's in an ill mind, ſtaring and blaſpheming at ſuch a rate, that even when he falls, you muſt think him an <hi>even-match</hi> for <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what's this ſtill to <hi>common Life,</hi> where Vice is expos'd indeed, but only in order to <hi>Imitation.</hi> A little <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> or whoring, tho with the Aggravation of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, Inceſt, and all the Fowleſt Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Names that cou'd raiſe bluſhes in a very Heathen, ſhall break no ſquares: The Spark ſtill ſhall obtain his beautiful and wealthy <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> three or four of his laſt conveniences ſoder'd up again, and marry'd to ſome plodding <hi>Countrey Gentleman,</hi> and all's as well as ever.</p>
               <p>They tell you 'tis a ſign he <hi>Repents</hi> when he <hi>Marrys,</hi> if they had ſaid this brought him in a fair way to't, they had ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but as 'tis, they are for the moſt part a Mouth or two ſhort of the mark.</p>
               <p>After all, one wou'd wonder how dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cou'd be ſo <hi>Charming,</hi> were it not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſet off with <hi>Lewdneſs,</hi> and how the ſame heavy Tale, only a new turn of words, it may be, and a ſilly naſty Song, or two, <hi>chopt</hi> in at the opening of a Scene, with perhaps ſome ingenious Dance of <hi>Devils</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:41990:128"/>and <hi>Hobby-Horſes;</hi> how ſuch ſtuff as this ſhould be heard, or read with ſo much as <hi>patience,</hi> much more with <hi>diverſion.</hi> For I dare affirm, that ſome hundreds of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Plays have the very <hi>ſame Plot</hi> at bottom, either ſtol'n from ſome of the Ancients, or a <hi>Spaniſh Novel,</hi> or from one another. The <hi>Squire</hi> and the <hi>Lady</hi> talk always alike. Tell me the <hi>Character,</hi> I'll as ſurely tell you their <hi>Converſation,</hi> as from one of—<hi>Rymes</hi> I'll gueſs at another, and wou'd any one be at the pains to make a <hi>Scrutiny</hi> through all our Comedys, there would be much fewer diſtinct <hi>Characters</hi> then he'd imagin, tho we have the advantage of <hi>humour</hi> too above all the World.</p>
               <p>But you can Learn more, you ſay, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by one <hi>Play</hi> then by 10 <hi>Sermons;</hi> and that may be too, as you may manage the matter, you ſometimes hearken to one, but you ſleep out all the other.</p>
               <p>There may indeed, ſome good <hi>Herbs</hi> be found among ſo many <hi>Poiſonous</hi> Weeds, but when they grow all together, and ten of the <hi>deadly plants</hi> to one that's <hi>wholeſome,</hi> who that regarded their <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Health,</hi> wou'd go in <hi>blindfold</hi> amongſt 'em, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſcuouſly to make a <hi>Sallad,</hi> in hopes only to meet with thoſe that would not hurt him?</p>
               <p>They may many of 'em appear inviting, but never the leſs dangerous, any more then the <hi>Manchinel,</hi> or <hi>Eve's Apple</hi> in the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:41990:128"/>
                  <hi>Indies,</hi> is a <hi>good Fruit,</hi> becauſe it looks <hi>Tempting</hi> and <hi>Glorious,</hi> but you ought to make your Will before you taſte it; which you may do if you are of their wiſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who are reſolv'd to try all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they conclude againſt any.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not torment you any more, or <hi>teize</hi> you any longer for what I'm affraid you'll never part with; I'd only ask you one reaſonable queſtion before I leave you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you ever found your ſelves really the wiſer, or better for reading any of theſe Modern <hi>Comedys</hi> (Farces rather, for the moſt of 'em now are no other)? I ask again thoſe who have any ſence of <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Modeſty,</hi> what ſort of reliſh you find they generally leave on your minds; whether they make you love <hi>Virtue,</hi> or <hi>Honour,</hi> or <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> or your <hi>Parents,</hi> or other Relatives, more then you did before you read 'em?</p>
               <p>If you find quite the contrary, (and if you don't, you have very <hi>good Fortune,</hi> or a very happy temper,) then pray be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to leave 'em to the <hi>Seeing</hi> and <hi>Reading</hi> of ſuch ſort of Perſons only as are uſually deſcrib'd in 'em.</p>

               <byline>By Madam <hi>CHACE.</hi>
               </byline>
               <p>WE're as little aſham'd to own the Charge, as to defend our Practice; nor do we like the <hi>Play-houſe</hi> e're the leſs for what <hi>Pryn</hi> ſays againſt it, ſince not only he, but many of the ſame ſtamp, will ſpeak as rudely of any thing elſe, that teaches People either Decency or Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. That <hi>Plays</hi> in themſelves are not only Diverting but Uſeful, none but Perſons o' your Senſe will deny; the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the Stage being to reform Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which is to be done by ſhowing Vice as well as Vertue. A Moral Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation can never be thought either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, or unlawful; and if we may read or repeat the Hiſtory of an Ill Man in Proſe, how comes the turning it into Verſe, to alter its Nature? Poetry has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought to teach with more Life and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:41990:129"/>Succeſs than Proſe, and the Poet than the Hiſtorian. <hi>Epic Poetry</hi> is above the Heads of the common People, 'tis Dramatic then muſt work upon 'em; where they ſee, as in a Glaſs, their own Vices and Follies, and may, if it be not their own Faults, learn to amend 'em.</p>
               <p>It's true, that <hi>Comedies</hi> uſing a lower walk, eſpecially our Modern, being as you juſtly accuſe 'em, too near ally'd to <hi>Farce,</hi> meaner and more common Vices muſt be therefore repreſented in them. If the Poet does this too groſly, he's a Dauber, not an Artiſt, and there is as much difference betwixt his Work, and that of a true Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as between a piece of the moſt wretched <hi>Sign-Poſt-Painter,</hi> and the laſt hand of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> or <hi>Vario.</hi> But this you cannot make a Reflection upon the Art it ſelf, any more than a raſh and miſchievous <hi>Quack</hi> can be reckon'd for an excellent Phyſician.</p>
               <p>Yet after all, there is more weight in what they uſually alledge for their Defence, than you will willingly allow: If a <hi>Play</hi> is to be a true <hi>Image of Life,</hi> and if your Lives be ſuch as will not ſo decently bear the <hi>Stage,</hi> whether ſhould they or you more juſtly bear the blame? I know you would fain ſhift it over to our Sex, but you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pretend it is we that have corrupted the Age, how much ſoever you have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to do ſo by us: It is not our Sex that are repreſented in your Theatres,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:41990:130"/>Drinking, Swearing, Scowring and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: Such a Character would be mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, and therefore could never pleaſe, although all the Malice of your Sex ſhould club to defend it. Now would any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Judge find fault with a Painter for drawing too much to the Life, though the verieſt Antick in Nature? If the Poet takes his Characters from your Perſons, they muſt be ſuch as you are, and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the more he hits you, the leſs he ſhould pleaſe you. But the Chyrurgion muſt probe the Wound, be it never ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</p>
               <p>You ſay he makes Vice ſucceſsful, and granting this true, where almoſt is it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe? will you avoid an Acquaintance your ſelves, for being the vileſt Rake in the World? Does Lewdneſs ever diſſolve your Friendſhips? nay, is it not that which for the moſt part unites and cements 'em? Is not your common and ordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation made up of fulſom Boaſting, the fowleſt Villanies? Much like the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of the Witches at their Sabbaths, who, they ſay, are oblig'd to repeat there, all the Miſchiefs they have acted ſince their laſt meeting.</p>
               <p>Now when any of this comes upon the Stage, tho' touch'd infinitely ſofter than the Life, who would admire if you do not like it? 'tis like your own Claret at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cone hand; as well as you lov'd it before, you now nauſeat and abhor it.</p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:41990:130"/>
               <p>Why then won't you mend, and afford better Copies for our Artiſts to work by? Do but reform your ſelves, and you'll ſee the Stage will reform inſenſibly by your Example.</p>
               <p>Nor is that true which you affirm, that we have no vertuous Characters preſented on our Theater in any of our Plays; ſo far from this, that you would, I believe, be put to it, to name any <hi>Play</hi> without 'em: And if they are not ſo frequent there as the contrary, I wiſh there were not too good reaſon for it, becauſe neither Truth, nor ſo much as Probability could bear it.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe the Expreſſions as indefen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and the principal Characters, and whole Management of all your <hi>Plays,</hi> as dangerous to Virtue, as lewd and as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral as you could deſire them, yet pray whom are we to thank for all this, and who generally are the Authors, your Sex or ours? We have ſome Two or Three, or it may be Half-a-dozen on the Stage writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Women, but how many Duſt-Carts would be ſufficient to clear <hi>Paul's</hi>-Church-Yard of thoſe wherewith your Sex have vex'd the World? If you write <hi>Plays,</hi> would you not have 'em ſeen? and if they are ſuch as are not fit to be ſeen, the more ſhame for the Authors.</p>
               <p>Beſides, of what <hi>Sex</hi> are thoſe whoſe Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and Office it is to regulate the Stage,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:41990:131"/>and to take care of theſe matters? We have not the power of correcting 'em, nor are they brought to us for our <hi>Imprimatur,</hi> nor can we know what's in a New-Play, before we come to ſee it. And would you indeed, when there are any Paſſages unfit for us to hear, have us ſtand up imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and in a Set Speech bear our Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony againſt them; or elſe abruptly leave the Place, and drive the crowding Pit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, leſt we ſhould by our Preſence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any thing of that nature.</p>
               <p>If the Springs be poyſon'd, the blacker are thoſe who perpetrate ſuch an abhorr'd piece of Villany: Let them be puniſhed, and the Fountains clear'd, or new diſcover'd; but deny not the Thirſty-Traveller the common Refreſhments of Nature. Nay, if even the <hi>Tragedies</hi> themſelves be infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they are fill'd with falſe Notions of Honour, and the very Heroes are made up of Revenge and Criminal Love, firſt, let thoſe very Notions be regulated in common Liſe; for while the beſt of your Sex think it honourable to cut one anothers Throats for the leaſt Affront, and on the moſt fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous Occaſions, a Caſt at Dice, an haſty Word, and (for what, Sir, you, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, eſteem leſs than all theſe) a Silly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; nay, while you meet in cold Blood, only out of a Compliment to your lewd and hot-headed Friend, and without any manner of Quarrel, ſend one another's

               <p>After all, none can deny but there are excellent Leſſons of Morality to be found in theſe Writers; indeed any <hi>Play</hi> without a Moral, is a Body without a Soul, I mean one grand Moral Truth, which is aim'd at through the whole Repreſentation, which are generally of greater concern and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Tragic, than in other Writings.

               <byline>By Sir <hi>THOMAS—</hi>
               </byline>
               <opener>
                  <salute>Madam, <hi>May it pleaſe your Venerability,</hi>
                  </salute>
               </opener>
               <p>HAd it been any Lady of ordinary Years and Character that had made an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of this Nature, I ſhould not ſo much have wonder'd at it: But for you who have been the Standard at leaſt this 40 Years, and have had the beſt School-Miſtreſs in the World, much longer to inſtruct you; for you, I ſay, to endeavour to <hi>Ogle</hi> in a poor young Fellow, that never did you any harm, and no more thought of making <hi>Love</hi> to you, than to his own <hi>Grandmother:</hi> 'Tis this Madam, that ſtupifies me, amazes me, and confounds me to that degree, that I can't ſpeak a word more, till I have ſate ſtill a quarter of an Hour, knaw'd my Pen, ſnuff'd my Candle, and look'd on the Picture of your Ladyſhip which I have juſt here before me.</p>
               <p>It's true Madam, that your Shape is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently well, tall and ſtrait, you have been only a little too much of the <hi>Heroine,</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:41990:132"/>and if you begin to bend a little now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe ample Shoulders of yours, we ought not to think 'tis any Decay of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Sympathy with the Earth, either in Diſpoſition or Complexion; but rather the mildneſs and goodneſs of your Temper, a ſort of a Condeſcention to the Stature of that blooming Lad, whom like a <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> God, you would fain take up in your Arms to make him happy.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs Madam, there is a moſt <hi>inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Leer</hi> in that admirable Face of yours, ſuch a Harmony between all its Parts, both with one another, and the whole Frame of your Venerable Structure, that I believe 'tis as difficult for any to look upon't, or ſee you Show with't (as the Sun does with his,) without feeling ſome extraordinary <hi>Motions,</hi> as 'tis to conceal thoſe <hi>Motions</hi> when once we feel 'em.</p>
               <p>VVhat Art have you to make your pretty <hi>Chin</hi> and <hi>Noſe</hi> keep time ſo exactly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? ſcarce one of your <hi>Temples</hi> beats truer to one another; without Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, they are both very Harmonious.</p>

               <p>No, I muſt not, before I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to do Juſtice to the ineſtimable Jewel, ſhut up in that fair Cabinet—a <hi>Tongue</hi> as ſweet, as ſoft as <hi>Innocence,</hi> as quiet as an <hi>Angel's.</hi> 'Tis <hi>underſtood,</hi> not <hi>heard;</hi> or if it does <hi>ſpeak,</hi> 'tis like <hi>Lovers Whiſpers,</hi> or <hi>gentle Murmurs,</hi> or <hi>falling Streams,</hi> or the <hi>Tide go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through Bridge,</hi> or <hi>Infant Thunders.</hi> (I mean when the <hi>Stream</hi> is <hi>even,</hi> and the <hi>Thunder</hi> a great way off.)</p>

               <p>Nothing certainly is a more bewitching thing than <hi>graceful motion:</hi> 'Tis a great part of a good Mind, if not the ſame with it. What ſhall I ſay then of yours, which if
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:41990:134"/>you are <hi>dancing,</hi> appears ſometimes as ſwift as the Wood-Nymphs, or that of <hi>Venus</hi> her ſelf clambring over Hedge and Ditch, thro Brakes and Bryars after her fair <hi>Adonis,</hi> as you now after yours. At other times you move like the <hi>Earth,</hi> on your own <hi>Axis,</hi> ſo equally, that 'tis inſenſible, or, as <hi>Ovid</hi> ſays, the Gods do, with both your <hi>Feet</hi> together, <hi>ſo imperceptibly,</hi> one wou'd think you never ſtirr'd an Inch out of your Place. They may talk of <hi>Poſture-Clark</hi> while they will, but if ever he cou'd mimic ſo exactly, or handle a Broom-ſtaff ſo handſomly, or ſhow the Changeling ſo naturally, or raiſe his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſo prodigiouſly, or ſhrink in one Hip ſo profoundly, as I have ſeen ſome do it, that ſhall be nameleſs, and who it may be, don't value themſelves ſo much on thoſe Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, as many others—why then, may I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have the diverſion of ſeeing the like again.</p>
               <p>Then for your Youth; for that Eternal Youth that hovers round you. That ſpite of Nature ſays you ſhan't grow old—What Nectar is't that ſtill preſerves it flouriſhing as ever?</p>
               <p>No <hi>Muſt,</hi> no <hi>Tarniſh,</hi> not the leaſt <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hardly ſo much as renders <hi>Veniſon</hi> grateful. Sure you've found out a way to <hi>Pot</hi> your ſelf up, and keep the Preſumptuous Air from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver kiſſing thoſe Sacred Lips only reſerv'd for him you honour with your Love.</p>

               <p>HA! ha! But indeed good Sir <hi>T.</hi> That you ſhou'd ever trouble your ſelf ſo as
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:41990:135"/>to write ſuch a long <hi>Letter</hi> to me! That you ſhould Load me and oppreſs me ſo with Compliments; indeed you do, indeed you do: <hi>Ah Sir,</hi> you very well know how to pleaſe Ladys; our <hi>Feeble Hearts,</hi> tho ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo deeply pre-engag'd (wou'd mine were at Liberty) hardly know how to refiſt you.</p>
               <p>I Remember very well in your Good <hi>Grandmothers</hi> time, (reſt her <hi>clack!</hi>) I ask your pardon Sir <hi>T.</hi> I proteſt, I meant your <hi>Mothers,</hi> or your <hi>Siſters</hi> rather, for we may be much of an <hi>Age,</hi> it may be, the <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> may lie on her ſide, what there is on't; I remember, I went out of <hi>hanging ſleeves</hi> juſt as ſhe came into 'em.</p>
               <p>But as I was ſaying, I beg your pardon, Sir <hi>T.</hi> what was't? The <hi>decays of Age,</hi> (nay, now I muſt beg my own). The uſual <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity</hi> of witty People, you know it by experience Sir <hi>T.</hi> is to forget what's juſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, tho they remember as perfectly as an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack,</hi> all that paſs'd 40 or 50 years before.</p>
               <p>But 'twas your <hi>Grandmother</hi> I think I was talking of, how ſhe wou'd play with you, and how <hi>prettily</hi> ſhe'd talk t'ye, <hi>Good old Creature</hi> as ſhe was (as I've heard my Nurſes tell me) and clap your <hi>Cheeks</hi> and gueſs at your future proficiency, a <hi>Wag</hi> my Liſe on't, an errant <hi>Wag,</hi> thus wou'd ſhe talk and laugh and talk again, till 'twou'd almoſt make one cry to hear her.</p>
               <p>But how little did ſhe think, when ſhe ſat dandling you upon one knee, and me
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:41990:136"/>upon another, how far was ſhe from <hi>Dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> there wou'd afterwards be ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate <hi>Converſation</hi> between us, ſo perfect a conſidence and extraordinary a <hi>Friendſhip?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That covers many Faults, and excuſes much <hi>Freedom:</hi> And indeed I would have my Friends be <hi>free, very free</hi> with me, as I would be with them. And therefore can't be really angry with any thing that comes from Sir <hi>T.</hi> tho it ſeems never ſo ſevere, becauſe he ſays ſo many other kind things to weigh againſt it, and becauſe indeed I have met with ſo much <hi>true kindneſs</hi> from him.</p>
               <p>Ah Sir <hi>T.</hi> you can't I believe forget, I'm ſure I never can, how <hi>Sweetly</hi> you and I have ſome years agone, rode together in my Fathers <hi>Coach</hi> in the <hi>Park.</hi> How many fooliſh ogling <hi>Dukes</hi> and <hi>Lords,</hi> would have handed me into the <hi>Coach,</hi> and out again, and drove along by us with their <hi>Eyes</hi> nail'd to the <hi>Glaſſes:</hi> For that was all I let 'em ſee, tho they made never ſo many <hi>Cringes</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gly Faces;</hi> as thus Sir, (give me a <hi>Sword</hi> or <hi>Cane</hi>) and thus, and then t'other way, (once more your pardon, I thought I had been all this while talking with you) and then throw their <hi>Wiggs</hi> one way, and their <hi>Eves</hi> t'other, that 'twou'd have made ones <hi>Heart</hi> almoſt melt to have ſeen 'em. But I ſtood my Ground ſtill: I valu'd not all their <hi>Civilitys</hi> any more then I did their railing: I let 'em deſpair on, and make choice either of the <hi>Ponds,</hi> or <hi>Trees</hi> to eaſe
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:41990:136"/>their Love, according as they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt inclin'd, and cou'd hear 'em <hi>Curſe</hi> my <hi>Countrey-breeding</hi> without any concern, while I remain'd ſafe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable in my own <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Innocence.</hi>

               <head>A <hi>Second Anſwer to</hi> Letter XXIII.</head>
               <byline>By a Young Lady.</byline>
               <p>HOw witty you are upon your poor <hi>Old Woman</hi> of <hi>Clouts,</hi> whom you have ſet up to ſay what you will againſt her, and then make her anſwer what you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>A fine <hi>Pindarical</hi> way of Writing, this which you are fallen into, or rather ſeem to affect above all Mankind, wherein you need not much fear being excell'd, ſince I dare promiſe you will never be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Wit,</hi> or at leaſt your <hi>Satyr,</hi> appears rather to be levell'd at <hi>Age</hi> in general, than at any particular Perſon, and not ſo much at any <hi>voluntary Weakneſs,</hi> as its <hi>inſeparable Infirmities.</hi> In this you talk like one of our <hi>Town Sparks,</hi> who imploy all their time in <hi>railing</hi> at whatever is <hi>wiſer</hi> and <hi>graver</hi> than themſelves, and contemn <hi>Age</hi> as they do <hi>Virtue,</hi> becauſe they live at ſuch a rate, that they have little hopes of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>But are there none that live to be old of your Sex as well as ours? Or is the reaſon why you expect fairer Quarter and more Reverence, becauſe as you manage Life, an Old Man is ſo great a Rarity?</p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:41990:138"/>
               <p>Be as ſevere as you pleaſe againſt <hi>Vice,</hi> and none can blame you for <hi>laughing</hi> at <hi>Folly,</hi> which is in it ſelf <hi>Ridiculous;</hi> but blame not <hi>Nature,</hi> unleſs you wou'd juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be eſteemed <hi>Inhumane,</hi> nor laugh at the <hi>Miſerable,</hi> which if you do, you can't eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the mark of Barbarity. Some of the <hi>Seythians</hi> ſeem to have much the ſame Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility with yours, who when their <hi>Parents</hi> grow <hi>decrepid</hi> and <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> turn 'em out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to <hi>wild Beaſts,</hi> or hang 'em up on <hi>Trees</hi> for the Vultures and other Ravenous Fowls to devour 'em. Yet there are ſome Creatures to whom we don't allow <hi>Reaſon,</hi> who may teach both them and you more <hi>Compaſſion</hi> and <hi>Humanity:</hi> The Young <hi>Stork</hi> carries its Aged Parent through the raging Flames, and over the wideſt Ocean, to a more Temperate Climate, and Place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement and Safety, as the Hero did his Father from burning <hi>Troy,</hi> to a happier Country, and a Peaceable End.</p>
               <p>It's true, <hi>Old Age</hi> is it ſelf a Diſeaſe, or rather a <hi>Complication</hi> of many.—But wou'd you your ſelf take it kindly, if you lay rack'd by the <hi>Gout</hi> and <hi>Stone,</hi> ſhould others that were in Health <hi>laugh</hi> at you, inſtead of <hi>pitying</hi> you, and at leaſt wiſhing, if not endeavouring to eaſe you?</p>
               <p>You muſt needs grant, there are many things in <hi>Age</hi> very deſirable; the advantage of their <hi>Experience,</hi> the extent of their <hi>Knowledge,</hi> the coolneſs of their <hi>Thought,</hi>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:41990:138"/>the ſteddineſs of their <hi>Judgment,</hi> while the Force and Warmth of Youth runs 'em into a Thouſand Extravagancies, and were there not <hi>graver Heads</hi> to manage 'em, they would ſoon, like <hi>Phaeton,</hi> fire the <hi>World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe Advantages of <hi>Age,</hi> we hope vou will not be ſo partial, as to Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize to your own <hi>Sex:</hi> If you wou'd at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any ſuch thing, I only deſire you'd anſwer me one ſhort Queſtion; When was our Nation happier, than when our <hi>Queen</hi> was an <hi>Old Woman?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 'tis neither our <hi>Sex,</hi> you ſay, nor <hi>Age</hi> with which you are ſo angry. 'Tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Peeviſhneſs,</hi> the <hi>Frowardneſs,</hi> the <hi>Fondneſs,</hi> the <hi>Affectation,</hi> the <hi>Garrulity,</hi> the <hi>Vanity</hi> of an <hi>Old Woman,</hi> that you can't en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: Be it ſo then only, be content we ſhou'd turn the <hi>Tables,</hi> and ſee how you like it. You know thoſe <hi>weakneſſes</hi> are not confin'd to our <hi>Sex,</hi> they are often charg'd in Groſs on thoſe who are the fartheſt from them. 'Tis not impoſſible to find <hi>Good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> and <hi>Age</hi> together, which more than countervails for the decay of <hi>Beauty.</hi> If there is ſometimes a little too much <hi>Sowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> try firſt how you can bear <hi>Contempt</hi> your ſelf, before you are ſo ready to blame others. The <hi>Fondneſs</hi> for which you fault 'em, I rather take to be the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> for this makes 'em good <hi>Grandmothers</hi> and tender <hi>Nurſes.</hi> If you ſhou'd find ſome one or two in an Age, ſuch awkward, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:41990:139"/>
                  <hi>Pieces</hi> as you have painted, you muſt reckon 'em as <hi>Monſters</hi> only, not a <hi>Sample</hi> of their <hi>Kind,</hi> elſe why d'ye wonder and hoot at 'em, when you fee 'em? and why are they deſpis'd, or at leaſt pity'd by their own <hi>Sex,</hi> as much as they can be by yours?</p>
               <p>But what, if I miſtake not, pinches cloſer than all the reſt; pray who have the moſt <hi>Fools</hi> of their Party? And whether is the greater number of <hi>Young-Old-Men,</hi> or <hi>Women?</hi> 'Tis not fair to <hi>inſult,</hi> becauſe you have got the advantage of us in <hi>Dreſs</hi> it ſelf, our own proper Province.</p>
               <p>A Man is never old now, till he's Bedrid, and there are more <hi>Beaus</hi> of Threeſcore, then there us'd to be of <hi>Twenty. Gray-Hairs</hi> you reckon as great a <hi>Diſgrace</hi> as Gravity, and you ſeem to have utterly diſcarded your <hi>Beards,</hi> for fear they ſhould ſo much as put you in mind of Wiſdom, and you have ſtript our Sex to diſguiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, rather than adorn your own. And proud of our Spoils, you turn the War againſt us, and fight us with our own Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, while many a poor young Woman is married to a <hi>Broom-ſtaff-Husband,</hi> who is little elſe but <hi>Hat</hi> and <hi>Periwig,</hi> and ſerves for nothing but a <hi>Warming-Pan</hi> for the <hi>old</hi> Decrepid Satyr, and loſes the beſt part of her <hi>Life,</hi> it may be all of it, betwixt <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles</hi> and <hi>Diſeaſes.</hi>

               <p>THE <hi>Fryars</hi> and the <hi>Mint</hi> wou'd be very <hi>thinly tenanted,</hi> did not the good <hi>Wives</hi> ſend their Husbands thither in ſuch <hi>Shoals,</hi> that there's hardly room enough to receive 'em: <hi>Thoſe Places</hi> are e'en <hi>over-ſtockt,</hi> as the <hi>Church-yards</hi> were in the <hi>Plague-time;</hi> and there need new <hi>Holes</hi> to <hi>pile</hi> up the Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loads that come thither; and one wou'd think the <hi>Women</hi> were in <hi>Fee</hi> with the <hi>Heads</hi> of thoſe <hi>Famous Societies,</hi> they make ſuch haſt to <hi>tranſplant</hi> their <hi>Families</hi> into their Territories.</p>
               <p>You can meet a <hi>Woman</hi> at no <hi>Place,</hi> no <hi>Age,</hi> no <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> but ſhe's <hi>expenſive</hi> enough to ruine a <hi>Midas:</hi> In her <hi>Education.</hi> In <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> whether you <hi>Marry</hi> or <hi>Bury</hi> her, or <hi>Church</hi> her, at the <hi>middle</hi> and <hi>both ends</hi> of her Life. For which reaſon the Greek Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammatiſt is viſibly partial to your Sex, when he ſays, A Man has <hi>two good Hours</hi> with ye, that of Day of <hi>Marriage,</hi> and Day of <hi>Death,</hi> ſince even the latter of 'em is a <hi>bitter-ſweet,</hi> and the <hi>Expence</hi> a Man is at in <hi>covering</hi> you <hi>ſafely,</hi> does almoſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail the <hi>Convenience.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41990:140"/>
               <p>You coſt ten times more than you are <hi>worth</hi> in <hi>rearing:</hi> You'll never pay for your <hi>keeping,</hi> and we were e'en as good let ye run <hi>wild,</hi> and truſt <hi>Nature</hi> with you.</p>
               <p>Beſides the <hi>difference</hi> in the <hi>Education</hi> of one of your <hi>Sex</hi> and one of <hi>ours,</hi> there's ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in what is <hi>expended</hi> for a <hi>Man,</hi> becauſe we may hope to ſee ſome <hi>good</hi> on't; but all that is beſtow'd on one of your <hi>unprofitable kind,</hi> is caſt on ſuch a <hi>Barren Soil,</hi> that we give it for <hi>loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Man</hi> may <hi>ſeek</hi> and <hi>make</hi> his <hi>Fortune,</hi> but ſcarce one <hi>Woman</hi> in <hi>Ten Thouſand.</hi> What they have muſt be <hi>given</hi> 'em, and unleſs there's good <hi>booty</hi> allow'd, they'll never off.

               <p>And yet the miſchief is, we muſt <hi>pay,</hi> as well as <hi>pray,</hi> for our own <hi>undoing.</hi> Not a few have been at ſuch <hi>vaſt Expences</hi> in the <hi>Courtſhip</hi> of their <hi>Wives,</hi> as were never <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburs'd</hi> by their <hi>Fortunes.</hi> Eternal <hi>Treats</hi> and <hi>Preſents.

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:41990:140"/>
               <p>And this even the poor <hi>Prentice knows</hi> by ſad Experience, who, when he marches out to — in Triumph with his <hi>Greaſie Beloved,</hi> as ſoon as he has ſeen her ſeated in an Arbor, and the <hi>Cheeſcake</hi> appears before him, ſtands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd to ſee what dreadful <hi>Dilapidations</hi> ſhe makes amongſt 'em in a <hi>quarter</hi> of an <hi>hour.</hi> 'Tis then time to <hi>feel</hi> the weight of his <hi>Pouch,</hi> and conſider how the <hi>Ready</hi> ſtands affected; and when he finds ſhe has almoſt <hi>eat</hi> to the bottom of his <hi>Pocket,</hi> how does his poor <hi>Heart beat,</hi> and he thinks a <hi>piece</hi> of it goes away every new <hi>Cake</hi> ſhe breaks, leſt he ſhou'd be forc'd to pawn his Gloves and Cane for the <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> of the <hi>Reckoning?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus it is, in Proportion, when the <hi>Amour</hi> is in an higher <hi>Sphere;</hi> for the greater the <hi>Quality,</hi> the greater ſtill the <hi>Expences.

The <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> is a great <hi>Abyſs,</hi> and all about her, <hi>Horſe-leaches</hi> feeding on its Banks. You muſt make a <hi>Golden Bridge</hi> (which is hard) for your <hi>Enemy</hi> to <hi>come to you,</hi> whereas none wou'd think much if 'twere to get <hi>ſhut</hi> of ſuch troubleſome Company.

               <p>I have read ſomewhere of a <hi>mad Fellow,</hi> who, when he and ſeveral of his <hi>Camerades</hi> were for ſome Miſdemeanor, forc'd to <hi>cast Lots</hi> for their <hi>Lives,</hi> when a <hi>white one</hi> fell to his <hi>ſhare,</hi> and one of his <hi>Companions</hi> that was yet to draw, was very much <hi>afraid,</hi> he ſold him his <hi>Lot</hi> for a ſmall matter, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41990:142"/>ventur'd his Life a <hi>ſecond time,</hi> and had as good <hi>Fortune</hi> as before, tho' he <hi>little deſerv'd</hi> it. Few <hi>Gameſters</hi> come off as he did, tho' all run little leſs <hi>hazards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shou'd I run out in the fooliſh Prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are the perpetual Appendages of this vain Sex, and which they think as neceſſary as their <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Rayment,</hi> all the <hi>clutter</hi> of <hi>Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, Chriſtnings,</hi> and the like, you'd ſay, I had <hi>tranſcrib'd</hi> all the <hi>Batchclor's Banquet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To leave this therefore, and come to a little more comfortable Subject. Suppoſe for once a <hi>Woman</hi> her ſelf ſhou'd be ſo good-natur'd as to think of ſome way to make you amends for all this <hi>Vexation;</hi> in ſhort, to keep ye no longer in <hi>ſuſpence,</hi> ſhou'd be ſo kind to <hi>make a Dye</hi> on't, why yet here you are n't <hi>rid</hi> of her, ſhe has a <hi>ſting</hi> in her <hi>Farewel,</hi> whoſe ſtroke is often <hi>Mortal,</hi> like other ſuch <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> even after ſhe her ſelf is dead. The <hi>Charge</hi> of her <hi>Burial</hi> will ſerve as a ſound <hi>alloy</hi> to the ſatisfaction of your <hi>fair parting,</hi> and either <hi>break</hi> you or the <hi>Tradeſinen,</hi> as <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s did before.</p>
               <p>And this you can no way <hi>avoid,</hi> without drawing the <hi>full cry</hi> of the <hi>Women</hi> againſt you. This is the beſt way for a <hi>Widower</hi> to make his <hi>Court,</hi> or pave his way to a <hi>Second Fortune;</hi> for ſuch is the <hi>Vanity</hi> of that <hi>Sex,</hi> that if they were put to their Choice, whether they'd <hi>live handſomly,</hi> or have a <hi>Magnificent Funeral,</hi> I verily believe they'd moſt of 'em rather take the <hi>latter,</hi> whatever ſhift they made while they were <hi>living.</hi>

Suppoſe him in the worſt conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and no way but this or a Gaol, would it not look more like <hi>Freedom</hi> to live out of the <hi>Priſoner</hi>'s <hi>Basket</hi> than out of <hi>Hers?</hi> 'Tis true he'd have nothing but <hi>Scraps</hi> from both, but then for the former he'd not be <hi>upbraided;</hi> beſides, he'd have a much more <hi>mild Durance,</hi> a ſort of a <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench Priſon</hi> where-ever he was, in compariſon of being turned over to a <hi>Widow,</hi> till Death cleared him at the General <hi>Gaol-delivery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the moſt diverting Scene is, when they are <hi>Geeſe o' both ſides,</hi> and cheat one another. The <hi>Citizen</hi> turn'd <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and the <hi>German-Princeſs</hi> rarely well met, and neither have juſt cauſe to complain. When the Widow lives high, keeps a noble Houſe and ſplendid Table, and has nothing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41990:147"/>but <hi>Sham-Deeds</hi> and baſtard <hi>Mortgages</hi> at the bottom: And the Noble 'Squire Eats, Drinks, Preſents, Treats and Plays as high as any, and yet's in debt for every <hi>Rag</hi> he wears, and had much ado to rig himſelf out for this weighty Expedition. But the <hi>Jeſt</hi> is when they come to <hi>weigh</hi> one another, and find nothing but <hi>Feathers</hi> o' both <hi>ſides,</hi> to ſee how they look, and how exactly like one another, only the Bride a little more <hi>Chagrin</hi> of the two, becauſe ſhe has diſgrac'd the Honour of her <hi>Character,</hi> and prov'd a Reproach to the Gravity and diſcretion of Widow-hood, by being impos'd on by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when a <hi>true Widow</hi> ought to <hi>Cheat</hi> all <hi>Mankind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet once more we'll ſuppoſe the very beſt, and that an <hi>honeſt Fellow</hi> ſhould chance to light on a <hi>Widow</hi> a little more <hi>free</hi> of her <hi>Purſe,</hi> though a moſt <hi>hide-bound Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe: Osborn</hi> has exactly told ſuch a Man's <hi>Fortune.</hi>

               <p>AND is a <hi>Widow</hi> really ſuch a <hi>frightful thing,</hi> Sir <hi>T.</hi> ſo much your <hi>averſion?</hi> And were you <hi>always</hi> of that <hi>mind?</hi> Are we all of us ſuch perfect <hi>Witches,</hi> ſuch abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable <hi>Blood-ſuckers,</hi> ſuch <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,</hi> ſuch unreaſonable, <hi>unconſcionable</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as you repreſent us? Or did you never hear of a <hi>ſly Thief,</hi> that cry'd, <q>The <hi>Grapes</hi> were <hi>ſour,</hi> when he cou'd not <hi>come at 'em?</hi> Or of a <hi>lewd Spark</hi> of your <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> who has often enough made it his <hi>buſineſs</hi> to <hi>defame</hi> that <hi>Vertue</hi> which he cou'd not <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>ruin?</hi>
                  </q> Juſt thus, I fancy, did that doughty Knight, Sir <hi>Hudibras,</hi> rail at his dear <hi>Widow,</hi> when he cou'd not <hi>catch</hi> her, and when he found both his <hi>ſham-Oaths</hi> and <hi>Whipping</hi> loſt upon her. But to Harp no more upon that <hi>ſtring,</hi> which it may be you will think makes but very <hi>jarring</hi> Muſick, I muſt ask leave to enter into the <hi>Merits</hi> of the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and conſider your angry waſpiſh <hi>complaints</hi> againſt poor <hi>Widows,</hi> who I find, as <hi>helpleſs</hi> as they are, and how much ſoever <hi>entitled</hi> to <hi>Heaven's Protection,</hi> muſt expect

But pray give me leave to ask you, Sir <hi>T.</hi> how came a poor <hi>ſimple Woman</hi> to be in a little while ſo ſtrangely <hi>alter'd?</hi> If we <hi>kill'd</hi> our <hi>Husbands</hi> indeed, and <hi>eat</hi> 'em afterwards, there might be ſomething in it, and the <hi>Riddle</hi> might eaſily be ſolv'd, according to the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Cannibals;</hi> becauſe if we <hi>believe</hi> them, we ſhould have all <hi>their Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence transfus'd</hi> into us: But that meer <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation</hi> ſhould work ſuch a Prodigious <hi>change,</hi> that only converſing with a <hi>Man</hi> for a few <hi>Years,</hi> or it may be <hi>Months,</hi> ſhould thus transform the moſt <hi>fooliſh</hi> and <hi>helpleſs</hi> thing in Nature into a meer <hi>She-Matchiavel,</hi> and make us too <hi>hard</hi> for all your <hi>Politick Noddles;</hi> This I confeſs is <hi>unaccountable,</hi> and <hi>admirable;</hi> and it muſt needs <hi>follow</hi> from it, that either <hi>we</hi> are very <hi>apt Scholars,</hi> or <hi>you</hi> are <hi>excellent Maſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But have not your <hi>Sex</hi> too the like <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> by <hi>Widow-hood?</hi> If you have, certainly, Sir <hi>T.</hi> it's very dangerous <hi>medling</hi> with you: For when you have <hi>ſwallow'd</hi> ſuch a <hi>Serpent</hi> as a <hi>Woman,</hi> you muſt be perfect <hi>Dragons;</hi> eſpecially if it happens to be a <hi>Widow</hi> that you have thus got <hi>rid</hi> of, at whoſe <hi>Happy Departure</hi> you would doubtleſs <hi>Triumph</hi> as much as the <hi>Man</hi> when he bury'd his <hi>Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Wife,</hi> and wear <hi>Garlands</hi> all your <hi>Life</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:41990:149"/>after. And yet (you know, Sir <hi>T.</hi>) the ſame <hi>expence</hi> of <hi>Vows</hi> and Oaths is requir'd to <hi>gain</hi> one of <hi>us,</hi> that you uſe with <hi>others;</hi> nay, you are often forc'd to <hi>double</hi> your <hi>Files,</hi> to <hi>clinch</hi> your <hi>Perjuries</hi> when you <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack</hi> a <hi>Widow,</hi> though you pretend to know our <hi>weak ſide</hi> never ſo exactly, becauſe we are ſure we <hi>know</hi> your <hi>Sex</hi> well enough, whatever you may <hi>know</hi> of <hi>ours;</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been <hi>deceiv'd</hi> once before, as it is great <hi>odds</hi> if when we were marry'd, we met with any <hi>better Fortune,</hi> we expect you ſhould <hi>juggle</hi> more <hi>artificially,</hi> and <hi>hang</hi> and <hi>drown</hi> more <hi>pathetically</hi> than our former Lovers, before you <hi>decoy</hi> us into a <hi>ſecond Nooſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when once you have your <hi>deſire,</hi> what <hi>Aſſurance</hi> have we after all our <hi>cunning,</hi> that we ſhall not <hi>catch</hi> a <hi>Tartar,</hi> that a <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dower</hi> ſhall not <hi>outwidow</hi> us, and over-ſhoot us in our own <hi>Bow?</hi> Have not you <hi>Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances</hi> and <hi>Conveyances</hi> as well as <hi>we,</hi> and <hi>Sham-Joyntures,</hi> and <hi>Airy Eſtates,</hi> which all <hi>vaniſh</hi> after <hi>Marriage,</hi> like the <hi>Ink</hi> of ſome of your <hi>falſe Deeds,</hi> by which you <hi>lur'd</hi> us into your <hi>clutches?</hi> It may be we may with much ado continue in your <hi>good Graces</hi> for ſome <hi>half a Year</hi> after Marriage; and a long time that too it's like many of you will ſay, and an unconſcionable while to be conſtant to <hi>one Woman:</hi> But when once that's paſt, and you can <hi>drain</hi> us of no more comfortable <hi>Old Gold,</hi> a <hi>few Pieces</hi> whereof we may have laid up for a <hi>comfort</hi> in <hi>Age,</hi> or for Legacies, or any extraordinary <hi>Accident,</hi> then we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41990:149"/>ſee you <hi>appear</hi> in your <hi>own ſhapes,</hi> and thoſe ſufficiently <hi>horrid:</hi> Nothing but <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Curſes,</hi> and kicking out of <hi>Doors.</hi> For if you turn us up to <hi>Alimony,</hi> and cannot find a way to <hi>cheat</hi> us of that too, we muſt take it as a great <hi>Favour,</hi> while you Drink, and <hi>Game,</hi> and <hi>worſe,</hi> and <hi>Revel</hi> in our <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,</hi> to your <hi>Hearts deſire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee <hi>your Pictures</hi> may be drawn, Sir <hi>T.</hi> as well as <hi>ours;</hi> and there are ſome <hi>Lines</hi> ſo remarkable in many of <hi>your Sex,</hi> that it is almoſt <hi>impoſſible</hi> not to <hi>hit</hi> 'em; and I appeal to the common Experience of the World, whether they do not know many <hi>Widow-Hunters,</hi> to whom this Deſcription agrees as well, and whom it <hi>fits</hi> as exactly, as if they had been <hi>taken meaſure</hi> of, and it had been made on <hi>purpoſe</hi> for them.</p>
               <p>After all, to be <hi>ingenuous,</hi> and <hi>acknowledge</hi> a <hi>Truth,</hi> though if the <hi>conſequence</hi> be not <hi>ſtrain'd,</hi> it will not hurt us, all <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> have ſome Perſons that are a <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> and <hi>Reproach</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> and to their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations:</hi> There are, it cannot be deny'd, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet</hi> and <hi>ill-temper'd,</hi> as well as <hi>crafty</hi> and <hi>over-reaching Perſons,</hi> of all <hi>ſorts</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, <hi>Maids, Wives,</hi> and <hi>Widows;</hi> ay, and of all <hi>Sexes</hi> too, Sir <hi>T.</hi> as I hope I have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd you already, of your <hi>own</hi> as well as <hi>ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why a <hi>Widow,</hi> who has more <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> in the World, who knows better how to <hi>manage</hi> a <hi>Family,</hi> than another, and how to <hi>value</hi> a good Husband, either by the <hi>Loſs</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:41990:150"/>of one of that <hi>Character,</hi> or the enduring the Tyranny of a <hi>bad</hi> one? Why ſuch a Perſon ſhould not be at leaſt as <hi>deſirable</hi> a <hi>Partner</hi> as a raw, young, <hi>giddy-headed Girl</hi> of <hi>ſixteen,</hi> who has juſt left <hi>playing</hi> with <hi>Lifeleſs Babbies,</hi> when ſhe comes to have <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> ones of her own to <hi>entertain</hi> her, and knows not what to do with them; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I am not <hi>ſharp-ſighted</hi> enough to <hi>diſcern,</hi> and therefore, Sir <hi>T.</hi> muſt refer the <hi>deciſion</hi> of ſo <hi>weighty</hi> an <hi>Affair</hi> to your <hi>nicer Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

               <p>EVen this <hi>Fool's Paradiſe</hi> quickly <hi>withers,</hi> and that <hi>Tinſil</hi> ſort of <hi>Happineſs</hi> which a Man finds in <hi>Love,</hi> ſoon wears off. After Marriage your <hi>Sex</hi> thinks it not worth the while to <hi>Diſſemble</hi> any longer; you have <hi>caught</hi> the <hi>Fiſh,</hi> and the <hi>Net</hi> is laid by: You have <hi>entrapt</hi> your <hi>Prey,</hi> and now the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s Face is ſhown, which before you ſo ſo carefully <hi>conceal'd.</hi>

               <p>Nor can a <hi>wiſe Man</hi> love a <hi>Fool,</hi> for that's <hi>unnatural:</hi> There is nothing <hi>agreeable</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, they don't <hi>Tally.</hi> 'Tis true, he may be a little tickled and pleaſed before <hi>Marriage:</hi> The <hi>Beauty</hi> hides the <hi>Folly,</hi> he was prepoſſeſs'd and hoodwink'd; now the truth is, <hi>Matrimony</hi> often do's Men that <hi>kindneſs,</hi> it gets 'em their <hi>eyes</hi> again, tho' 'tis ſomething a ſharp <hi>Remedy.</hi>

               <head>LETTER XXVII. <hi>That no</hi> Woman <hi>can be</hi> Faithful <hi>in</hi> Abſence.</head>
               <byline>By Sir <hi>Thomas—</hi>
               </byline>
               <p>YOur ingenious <hi>Sex</hi> finds out many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions from that General Rule, <hi>Till Death us do part;</hi> and 'tis worthy <hi>Chronicle</hi> indeed to find one of ye <hi>conſtant</hi> half ſo long. I think we have Inſtances of ſome <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> that have made a ſhift to keep Honeſt without <hi>good looking after,</hi> and you may well boaſt of your Phoenix, <hi>Penelope,</hi> who held out a <hi>Siege</hi> as long as that of <hi>Troy,</hi> where her <hi>Husband</hi> was carrying on one of the Principal <hi>Attacks:</hi> But you are forc'd to go as high as the <hi>Fabulous Age</hi> for one ſuch Story, while we ſee there's few Husbands need go over their <hi>Threſholds</hi> to find the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;</hi> for if they are but <hi>abſent</hi> in another <hi>Room,</hi> it may be as <hi>effectual,</hi> as if at the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most diſtance</hi> the <hi>four Seas</hi> wou'd allow him. Which, by the way, are the exact meaſure of a Woman's <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and our Great Grandfathers <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> for was there ever ſuch a <hi>Law</hi> made in any other Nation of the World, that a Man muſt <hi>thankfully receive</hi> all the two legg'd <hi>Bleſſings</hi> his <hi>Bountiful Wife</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:41990:158"/>will beſtow upon him, tho' he has no more to do with 'em than the <hi>Great Mogul?</hi> If it be pleaded for you, that you are <hi>tempted</hi> to <hi>Falſhood</hi> by the <hi>Remiſsneſs</hi> of the <hi>Laws</hi> on theſe occaſions; may it not with more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be <hi>retorted,</hi> that had you any <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> you wou'd therefore be the more <hi>Faithful.</hi> Sometimes you don't love <hi>Reſtraint,</hi> and 'tis being ty'd up ſo <hi>cloſe</hi> makes you break your <hi>Halter.</hi> But what can you ſay in this caſe, unleſs that even <hi>this Law</hi> has not left you <hi>Rope</hi> enough, and that the <hi>four Seas</hi> ought, in Chancery at leaſt, to be extended to both the <hi>Indies,</hi> which wou'd doubtleſs have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good Conſequences, and make your <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Abſence</hi> more <hi>comfortable</hi> to you, and profitable to themſelves; and in the mean while you wou'd not be ſuch <hi>unfruitful,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Members of the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> 'Twou'd effectually prevent much <hi>Jealoufie</hi> and <hi>ill Blood</hi> in the <hi>Nation.</hi> A Man wou'd not then look <hi>ſour</hi> upon his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> at his return from a long Voyage, only becauſe ſhe had been Trading too in his abſence, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving that little Stock he left her; whoſe unkindneſs to her might have very <hi>ill Effects,</hi> make her, it may be, loſe what ſhe goes with, if not break her <hi>tender heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then if one <hi>Law</hi> be favourable to the <hi>Sex,</hi> there's <hi>another Cuſtom</hi> that I wonder you don't <hi>Petition</hi> againſt, and <hi>try</hi> to get it alter'd in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that is, the <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable time</hi> you are oblig'd to ſtay without <hi>hearing</hi> from <hi>your Husband,</hi> before <hi>you</hi> dare
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41990:159"/>
                  <hi>hope</hi> him <hi>dead,</hi> and admit the <hi>conſolation</hi> of another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seven Years!</hi> why, 'tis a <hi>Life-time,</hi> and ſuch a tedious ſtate of <hi>Widow-hood,</hi> more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a <hi>Civil-Death,</hi> than Rowing Ten Years in the Galleys. The only <hi>Comfort</hi> is, you can ſet <hi>one Law</hi> againſt t'other, and then the <hi>Scales</hi> will be pretty <hi>even.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greateſt wonder to me is, that any ſhou'd be ſo unreaſonable as to expect <hi>Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> and Conſtancy from you. Why does he not as well expect <hi>ſoftneſs</hi> from a <hi>Flint,</hi> or Oyl from a <hi>Pumice-ſtone?</hi> The <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>Seas</hi> are old <hi>Similies,</hi> for their <hi>Conſtancy</hi> as well as their <hi>Silence:</hi> And if 'tis not in their <hi>Nature</hi> to be <hi>conſtant,</hi> hardly in <hi>Evil,</hi> much leſs ſure in <hi>Vertue,</hi> and leaſt of all, in ſo ſtrong a Vertue as <hi>Fidelity,</hi> which they may pretend is too <hi>rough</hi> and <hi>maſculine</hi> for their <hi>ſofter Natures.</hi> And if this ben't to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, even <hi>after Marriage,</hi> where there are all the moſt Sacred Tyes imaginable, all the Obligations of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> to keep 'em ſteady, how thick muſt his <hi>Swerd</hi> be, who hopes for it <hi>before Marriage,</hi> in the <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of him to whom they vow'd <hi>Eternal Friendſhip?</hi> Is't not fair for a Woman to ſtand to her Word, while you are by, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member her of it? We know they are <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful Creatures,</hi> they are <hi>weak,</hi> and if they venture <hi>alone,</hi> we muſt expect they'll <hi>fall,</hi> and ſo <hi>brittle,</hi> that if they do, we may be ſure they'll be <hi>broken.</hi> But they'll ſay, I'm
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41990:159"/>now Arguing on their ſide. Let 'em make what uſe they pleaſe on't, but this is matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> and ſhews that they are not, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>conſtant</hi> if you truſt 'em out of ſight. For the Lover takes his Miſtreſſes <hi>Vows</hi> and Promiſes along with him: He has 'em in his own <hi>keeping,</hi> as afterwards, if he gets her, the <hi>Writings</hi> of her <hi>Eſtate,</hi> and let him <hi>look</hi> to 'em, and not blame her if they are <hi>lost,</hi> nor be ſo unreaſonable to expect her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy ſhou'd follow him all the World over.</p>
               <p>A Woman's <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly what they report of <hi>ours:</hi> She'll claim the <hi>Clergy</hi> of a <hi>Lover,</hi> and pretend they may be <hi>broken</hi> upon good <hi>occaſions,</hi> and thoſe ſhe'll never <hi>want,</hi> till ſhe wants <hi>Invention</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence:</hi> And concludes without any.</p>
               <p>Her <hi>Friends</hi> are <hi>againſt</hi> the <hi>Match,</hi> and ſhe dares not go againſt her <hi>Conſcience</hi> and Intereſt in a matter of ſuch great <hi>concern.</hi> Or he is <hi>unfaithful first,</hi> and gives her both Example and Authority to treat him in that manner. Or he is not in a <hi>capacity</hi> to make good the <hi>Propoſals</hi> he made her; and if they marry'd, they ſhou'd only live miſerably, and <hi>ſtock</hi> the World with a <hi>Race</hi> of <hi>Beggars:</hi> Or he has <hi>neglected</hi> and <hi>affronted</hi> her, either by <hi>Silence,</hi> or want of that <hi>Reſpect</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Faithful <hi>Lover.</hi> Or ſhe has heard of ſome of his <hi>former Pranks,</hi> and, forſooth, can't think ſhe's bound by any Promiſe to a Perſon of ſo little <hi>Vertue.</hi> All theſe ſhe thinks <hi>good Reaſons,</hi> tho' the true one lies ſtill at the <hi>bottom.</hi>

               <p>His <hi>Fortune</hi> is not <hi>plentiful</hi> enough to maintain her <hi>Extravagance</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> or ſhe has ſome <hi>richer Fool</hi> that makes his <hi>Addreſſes,</hi> and outbids the <hi>Joynture</hi> offer'd by the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:</hi> Or it may be he's a <hi>Man of Senſe,</hi> and then he's <hi>half condemn'd</hi> before any other tenders his <hi>Service:</hi> However, if ſome <hi>brisk Fop attacks</hi> her, he infallibly carries all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, having the <hi>Fate</hi> of her <hi>Sex</hi> to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his <hi>Pretenſions;</hi> and oftentimes ſhe only <hi>changes</hi> for the ſake of <hi>change,</hi> for dear charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing irreſiſtible <hi>Variety.</hi> The <hi>Impreſſion</hi> of her former <hi>Vows</hi> wears off from her Memory as faſt as the <hi>Face</hi> of him to whom ſhe made 'em: There are none of thoſe pretty little <hi>Amorous Quarrels,</hi> which us'd to <hi>blow</hi> up and feed their <hi>Paſſion</hi> when <hi>preſent.</hi> Nor are <hi>Letters</hi> ſtrong enough to ſupply the want of actual Management, and appearance in proper Perſon: They are too <hi>cold</hi> to keep <hi>Love</hi> long alive, or to continue it in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant <hi>Heart,</hi> where at leaſt 'tis eaſily <hi>dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> out by a <hi>newer,</hi> and therefore more <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable Amour.</hi> There's as much difference between actual Perſonal <hi>Addreſſes,</hi> and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolary Confabulations, as there is between a diſputable <hi>Bill</hi> and good hard <hi>Ready Money.</hi> Woman is indeed ſo far like a <hi>New diſcover'd</hi> Country, that the <hi>firſt comer</hi> pleads a Right to her; but if he withdraws for a while, and a ſtronger <hi>Rival ſteps</hi> in, he <hi>ſeizes</hi> the <hi>Ground</hi> as his own, cuts up the <hi>Turff,</hi> and <hi>Heirs</hi> the whole <hi>Plantation.</hi>

               <byline>By Madam <hi>Godfrey.</hi>

               <p>WHether or no <hi>Abſence</hi> be the more <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious</hi> to a <hi>Lover,</hi> or his being <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> to <hi>ſolicit</hi> his <hi>Suit</hi> with the <hi>Fair</hi> One; which ſide ſoever of the Queſtion I ſhould engage in, it could be no <hi>Reflexion</hi> on our <hi>Sex,</hi> at leaſt not diſtinctly from yours; for there have bin more <hi>falſe Theſeus</hi>'s then <hi>Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneſtra</hi>'s, and till you could ſhow us <hi>one</hi> of your Sex that wou'd be proof againſt <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi> and <hi>Opportunity,</hi> that when his <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> was <hi>abſent</hi> would refuſe a <hi>Richer,</hi> and a <hi>Handſomer</hi> if the Offer was made, you muſt not lay all the <hi>weight</hi> on <hi>others ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> but ſupport at leaſt an <hi>equal ſhare</hi> in your <hi>proper Perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But letting that reſt, I ſhall now examine what you Advance on <hi>this Subject,</hi> and doubt not to prove that in many <hi>Caſes,</hi> and on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Accounts, Abſence</hi> is more favourable to a <hi>Lover</hi> than the contrary; he has many Advantages by it, which he cou'd not have if preſent with <hi>her</hi> he <hi>loves.</hi> For he can <hi>write</hi> to her, and <hi>expreſs</hi> many things that <hi>way</hi> which he <hi>could</hi> not any other. It remedies
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41990:161"/>his <hi>Baſhfulneſs,</hi> (if any of your <hi>Sex</hi> are yet <hi>Oppreſt</hi> with that unfaſhionable Malady:) However, he avoids being confounded and <hi>dazled</hi> with the <hi>Splendor</hi> of her <hi>Beauty,</hi> which has often ſtruck <hi>dumb</hi> as ſtout Men as Sir <hi>T.</hi> without any Reflexion upon his <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</hi> The fear leaſt any Expreſſion leſs <hi>proper</hi> or <hi>reſpective</hi> ſhou'd <hi>drop</hi> out unawares, as it often happens in <hi>Converſation,</hi> is here <hi>avoided:</hi> A Lady will bear many things in <hi>black</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> which it may be ſhe wou'd not care to have told her by the <hi>Writer</hi> if he were preſent. Many don't <hi>love</hi> to <hi>hear</hi> they are <hi>lov'd,</hi> or at leaſt, think it not <hi>decent</hi> to ſit ſtill and hear their own <hi>Panegyric,</hi> which yet they can <hi>read</hi> well enough, if there be not too much <hi>daubing</hi> in't. A <hi>Lover</hi> may talk on as long as he pleaſe with his Pen, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal all his <hi>Paſſion</hi> without fear of being <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted,</hi> either by the <hi>Wit,</hi> or <hi>Ill-nature,</hi> or <hi>Modeſty</hi> of his Miſtreſs. Many can <hi>write</hi> better than they can <hi>ſpeak,</hi> eſpecially Men of <hi>Sence,</hi> and this Obſervation ſcarce ever fails if they have not had much <hi>acquaintance</hi> or <hi>converſation</hi> in the World; and to ſuch as theſe, <hi>Abſence</hi> gives a mighty advantage: A Lover has time to <hi>think</hi> twice, to <hi>chooſe</hi> his <hi>thoughts,</hi> and only repreſent ſuch as will be moſt favourable to his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> when he makes it known by <hi>Letter;</hi> but in <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> he has no time nor room to <hi>turn</hi> an <hi>Idea,</hi> but his <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> muſt take it as ſhe finds it. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity</hi> and <hi>Fidelity</hi> plead hard for him in his <hi>abſence,</hi> if he has made any <hi>Progreſs</hi> in his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41990:162"/>
                  <hi>Amour</hi> before he leaves her, which the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ſuppoſes: <hi>Lovers</hi> love to pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and repreſent the dear <hi>Object</hi> as <hi>amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> as their <hi>Affection</hi> and <hi>Imagination</hi> can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it, and as the <hi>Man</hi> ſees his <hi>Lady</hi> in this <hi>advantagious Dreſs,</hi> ſhe contemplates him in one that's full as agreeable, and both are ſure to <hi>forget</hi> what may <hi>diſpleaſe</hi> 'em, or make <hi>excuſes</hi> and <hi>alleviations,</hi> which they can't ſo well do when they have the <hi>Object</hi> it ſelf before their <hi>Eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then if to all this there be a faithful <hi>Friend</hi> of either ſide, a Confident to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi> it may go better on, and make a <hi>lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger progreſs</hi> in <hi>Abſence</hi> than otherwiſe. When Perſons are long preſent and converſing with one another, they are apt to find out each others <hi>Faults</hi> and <hi>Imperfections:</hi> It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but they muſt repeat the <hi>ſame things</hi> over and over, unleſs of an extraordinary <hi>Wit, Invention, Memory,</hi> and <hi>Judgment:</hi> At beſt there is but a <hi>dull Satiety,</hi> and <hi>Wit</hi> it ſelf, with nothing elſe for a long while to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, would be apt to be <hi>tireſome</hi> and <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive:</hi> Now <hi>Abſence heightens</hi> and <hi>ſharpens</hi> the <hi>Paſſion,</hi> as <hi>Hunger</hi> does the <hi>Appetite,</hi> and then none but a <hi>Lover</hi> can gueſs the <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi> that parted <hi>Lovers</hi> experiment when they <hi>meet</hi> again. How <hi>eagerly</hi> they <hi>claſp</hi> each other to their <hi>Breaſts,</hi> and <hi>look,</hi> and <hi>ſigh,</hi> and <hi>claſp</hi> again, and are never <hi>weary.</hi> A ſight that would be enough to <hi>Convert</hi> the moſt <hi>averſe</hi> to <hi>Love,</hi> or at leaſt make 'em <hi>Envy</hi> ſuch a <hi>Happineſs</hi> as the <hi>ſourneſs</hi> of their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> would never let them <hi>poſſeſs.</hi>

               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:41990:162"/>
               <p>I had like to have forgot <hi>Songs,</hi> and <hi>Verſes,</hi> and a hundred <hi>pretty Fancies,</hi> which a Lover may ſend to his Miſtreſs when abſent, tho' it looks often but ſcurvily to repeat 'em him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when <hi>preſent,</hi> which is like carrying a Letter from himſelf to the Perſon to whom it's directed. Beſides the <hi>partiality</hi> of, I think, all Men living, at leaſt that ever I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, for their own Works, would be apt to render the poor <hi>Author</hi> uneaſie, and diveſt him of that <hi>complaiſance</hi> which is ſo neceſſary to one that pretends to our Hearts, if we ſhould think fit to diſlike any thing in them, either for the Tryal of his <hi>Good Nature</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides, as a Lady can bear much more in Writing than <hi>Face</hi> to <hi>Face,</hi> and her Lover expreſs himſelf more to his <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> ſo ſhe can ſay more to him this way if ſhe's ſecure of his Fidelity, Diſcretion, and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, than if he were actually preſent. She can tell him a <hi>thouſand things</hi> here, which would put a terrible <hi>Violence</hi> on the <hi>Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs</hi> of our Sex, ſhould ſhe venture to ſay half as much before him: Nor would ſhe be this way in danger of his <hi>Tranſports,</hi> or ſeeing him throw himſelf out o' <hi>Window</hi> for <hi>Joy</hi> that ſhe has granted him ſuch a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi> On all which Accounts, beſides <hi>divers</hi> and <hi>ſundry Reaſons</hi> more, too <hi>long</hi> to <hi>repeat,</hi> I conclude, that <hi>Abſence</hi> is moſt <hi>Advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> to a <hi>favour'd Lover.</hi>

And I wiſh there were not reaſon to ſuſpect they had quite different <hi>Motives</hi> for ſuch an Eſtabliſhment, ſince they cou'd not be ſo little acquainted with your <hi>Inclinations,</hi> as not to know that this was the direct way to make you long for what they pretended to deny you. A long <hi>Lent</hi> in truth they impoſe on your tender Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, not only for two or three Weeks, or a <hi>Year,</hi> but all your <hi>Lives</hi> together, unleſs ſome Charitable <hi>Confeſſor</hi> will give you a Diſpenſation from the Severity of your <hi>Rule.</hi> I once more entreat you not to flatter your ſelves, that 'tis my <hi>fondneſs</hi> for your <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:41990:163"/>that renders me averſe from having you <hi>clapt</hi> into theſe <hi>Pinfolds.</hi> No, you may aſſure your ſelves 'tis the quite contrary; for I think there's juſt ground to fear that reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Fire</hi> to ſo narrow a <hi>compaſs,</hi> will make it <hi>blaze</hi> more furiouſly, unleſs it cou'd be quite <hi>ſtifled.</hi> When 'tis thus <hi>reverberated,</hi> what can withſtand it? The <hi>damming</hi> up this vaſt <hi>weight</hi> of <hi>Waters</hi> is very <hi>dangerous,</hi> for if they once find a way through the Banks, as 'tis hard if they long contain ſo <hi>ſlippery</hi> an <hi>Element,</hi> then there's no Remedy, but they bear all down before 'em.</p>
               <p>To be plain, I'm afraid thus wou'd you deal with us, were your Sex generally <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd</hi> to <hi>Nunneries.</hi> You'd make a deſperate <hi>Sally</hi> at one time or other, fall upon our <hi>Sex</hi> when unprepar'd to reſiſt ye, over-run all <hi>Mankind,</hi> and <hi>beat</hi> us, as the <hi>Amazons</hi> did their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> till they made 'em <hi>Raviſh</hi> 'em in their <hi>own Defence,</hi> and meerly to <hi>ſave</hi> their <hi>Lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Fire</hi> we <hi>ſee</hi> and <hi>wonder</hi> at in the Letters from a <hi>Nun</hi> to a <hi>Cavalier,</hi> are no more than <hi>painted Flames,</hi> in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of thoſe which muſt needs torment ſuch as are thus fatally immur'd. This they <hi>fan,</hi> but can never <hi>allay</hi> by their <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> at the <hi>Grates,</hi> which ſure muſt be a <hi>lively</hi> Emblem of a <hi>darker Priſon,</hi> ſince this muſt needs keep their <hi>Deſires</hi> enrag'd, without giving, 'em any <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> unleſs you'll ſuppoſe 'em all ſuch <hi>very Veſtals,</hi> as to feel no more <hi>tingling</hi> when their <hi>Hands</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:41990:164"/>are preſs'd and kiſs'd thro' the <hi>Grate,</hi> than thoſe very <hi>conſcious Bars</hi> that part the <hi>eager Lovers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when 'tis once come ſo far, and a ſettled <hi>Amour</hi> is <hi>formed</hi> between 'em, 'tis well if <hi>ſcaling Walls,</hi> and <hi>breaking Necks</hi> don't ſhortly follow, or it may be, more miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Conſequences than either.</p>
               <p>That poor Saint had a great deal of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done her, who put her ſelf in <hi>Man's Cloaths</hi> on purpoſe to get into a <hi>Monaſtery,</hi> and having there behav'd her ſelf ſo well, as to gain the favour of her Superiors, was it ſeems ſo envy'd by the reſt of the <hi>Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> that they moſt Feloniouſly hired a Strumpet to lay a Baſtard to her Charge, likely enough of their own begetting. For which the poor Innocent, not daring to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her ſelf, was confin'd to her <hi>Cell,</hi> and condemn'd to very rigorous Penance all her Life. In which modeſt <hi>ſilence</hi> ſhe at laſt dy'd, and then all <hi>came</hi> out; for ſhe was not only found a <hi>Woman,</hi> but <hi>Intacta</hi> too, if we'll believe the <hi>Skilful</hi> Monk that relates it.</p>
               <p>Now 'twas very well for this <hi>poor Girl</hi> that ſhe had no <hi>Companion</hi> aſſign'd her, no <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow</hi> to comfort her all that while, nor none in her <hi>Sickneſs</hi> to <hi>undreſs</hi> her, or to <hi>admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> any thing whereof there might have been occaſion.</p>
               <p>And 'twou'd be yet worſe, I fancy, if ſome <hi>devout Brother</hi> ſhou'd for ſome ſuch Reaſon, and out of meer <hi>contempt</hi> of the World, and hatred of the <hi>Vices</hi> of our <hi>bad
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41990:164"/>Sex,</hi> reſolve to <hi>diſguiſe</hi> himſelf in the <hi>Habit</hi> of a <hi>Woman,</hi> and ſo by that means get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd among the <hi>Siſters,</hi> which they ſay, has not been without <hi>Preſident.</hi> How <hi>ſweetly,</hi> how <hi>innocently</hi> wou'd he live amongſt 'em? And if he ſhou'd happen to die there, like the She-Monk already mention'd, how many Ehs! and ſqueeks wou'd the poor Nuns make when they went to lay him out, and made the <hi>Diſcovery?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Twou'd be well if Mother <hi>Abbeſs</hi> her ſelf did not come running in, as once before, with the Fryar's Breeches about her <hi>Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> to ſee what was the matter.</p>
               <p>What caution ſoever is us'd in theſe <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,</hi> ſomething or other will now and then break out, to the Scandal of Mother Church, and <hi>Diverſion</hi> of us <hi>Hereticks,</hi> whence we can't help concluding that how <hi>Angelical</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their <hi>Profeſſion</hi> may be, their <hi>Practice</hi> is juſt like that of other <hi>pieces</hi> of <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> that other French <hi>Nuns</hi> may be like thoſe who have bin diſcover'd to be no better then they ſhou'd be, and that the <hi>Nuns</hi> of <hi>France</hi> may be of a piece with thoſe throughout all the World.</p>
               <p>If this be thought too Uncharitable a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, we'll find out another way for <hi>Nature</hi> to work for it ſelf, for it can't be <hi>perfectly unactive,</hi> as long as there's <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We'll believe then that all their <hi>Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds</hi> are not ſtock'd at the ſame rate, and that they don't all <hi>kill</hi> their <hi>Children</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they han't occaſion for't. But then
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41990:165"/>they often <hi>kill themſelves,</hi> and one can ſcarce tell which is <hi>worſe.</hi> They ſee <hi>Viſions and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> are fill'd with new <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Prophecy,</hi> commence all <hi>Pazzis</hi> and <hi>Julians,</hi> and <hi>Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets</hi> and <hi>Kates,</hi> are <hi>Canoniz'd</hi> and <hi>Pray'd</hi> to, and their <hi>Lives</hi> enter'd in their <hi>glorious Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends,</hi> to the encouragement of Catholicks and confuſion of <hi>Infidels,</hi>—and all this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Blaſt</hi> works <hi>upward. Progenies coeli eſt, &amp; conſcia Flammina futuri</hi>—I ask your Pardon, Ladies, for that ſcrap of that <hi>Beaſtly Language,</hi> which ſlipt from me before I was aware, but as <hi>big</hi> as it ſounds, your learned Advocate <hi>(Anonyma)</hi> who yoaked me ſo hard in defence of your <hi>Topknots,</hi> can eaſily tell you the meaning on't, which on the word of an <hi>honourable Enemy,</hi> is no manner of <hi>hurt,</hi> and nothing elſe but an end of <hi>Hudibras</hi> before recited, though dreſs'd ſo <hi>fine</hi> that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would hardly know it.</p>
               <p>Once more pardon for <hi>this digreſſion,</hi> which if you do not give me preſently, I muſt be forced to make another <hi>as long</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it.</p>
               <p>But I think we were talking of <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> which if any of your <hi>Sex</hi> inclines to <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> will be ſure to have a large ſhare in it. It Commands in you all, but it <hi>Reigns,</hi> it <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs</hi> in a <hi>Cloiſter,</hi> where either <hi>Guilt</hi> or <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> makes People <hi>Superſtitious,</hi> gives 'em <hi>falſe Notions</hi> of Religion, and wild and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Fancies; making 'em all Spiritual.</p>
               <p>Then perpetual poring on their <hi>Lives</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> and old muſty Legends, gives 'em a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41990:165"/>ſtrong Byaſs that way, makes 'em all Spiritual <hi>Don Quixots,</hi> and ſets 'em agog for ſome redoubted Adventure in their Religious ſort of <hi>Knight Errantry,</hi> which they themſelves confeſs have been the Original of ſeveral of their <hi>Orders,</hi> particularly of good St. <hi>Loyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>'s, whoſe <hi>Peaceable</hi> and <hi>diſintereſted Society</hi> have been ever ſince they were firſt cubb'd ſo great a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> to the World.</p>
               <p>But what's all this, you'll perhaps anſwer, to the <hi>Engliſh Ladies?</hi> You know we are good Proteſtants, and renounce <hi>Nunneries</hi> and all their works (except their <hi>Point</hi> and <hi>pretty Pictures</hi>) and ſhou'd not care to be of any <hi>Order</hi> amongſt 'em, except we might either be <hi>Gallopping Nuns,</hi> or, — But 'twould be enough to reply, that <hi>impartial Juſtice</hi> falls without reſpect on <hi>all</hi> your <hi>Sex,</hi> of whatever Age, or Countrey, or <hi>Religion,</hi> and theſe <hi>Nunneries</hi> being what you ſo much boaſt of, to ſhew you can live without us, they deſerved that particular <hi>notice</hi> which I have taken of 'em.</p>
               <p>Nor is that all, for <hi>you your ſelves,</hi> you Proteſtant Ladies, who have renounced all <hi>venial Sins</hi> and <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> and no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Virginity</hi> the moſt excellent <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> than you believe <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> even you have lately had a <hi>ſerious propoſal</hi> to make a <hi>Schiſm</hi> among your Sex, ſet up <hi>Proteſtant Nunneries,</hi> and <hi>exclude</hi> your ſelves from the <hi>World:</hi> The ſureſt way I muſt confeſs, to procure you <hi>Husbands.</hi> But if you <hi>deſign</hi> any thing elſe, 'tis eaſie to ſhew

               <p>I Wonder what <hi>Fit</hi> of <hi>Ingenuity</hi> has lately poſſeſs'd our angry <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> that he ſo fairly confeſſes in this Letter, that the very Reaſon of his being againſt our <hi>inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> our ſelves in <hi>Nunneries,</hi> is, leaſt for that very Cauſe he ſhould be more paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately <hi>enamour'd</hi> of us.</p>
               <p>It is not only <hi>Women</hi> then, I perceive, who are eagerly <hi>deſirous</hi> of what is <hi>forbidden</hi> them, and that for no other Reaſon.</p>
               <p>But yet we would be ſo <hi>civil</hi> to this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, altho' our declar'd <hi>Enemy,</hi> that we are willing to own his <hi>Ingenuity</hi> has had a <hi>reſembling Effect</hi> upon us; we are not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proof againſt ſo much <hi>Good-nature;</hi> and we muſt acknowledge, if any thing could make us <hi>out of Love</hi> with <hi>Nunneries,</hi> it would be the very ſame Reaſon that he brings againſt 'em: For fear they ſhould make him too violently in <hi>Love</hi> with us.</p>
               <p>For what Pity would it be, that a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Gentleman, in the <hi>Flower</hi> of his <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> the <hi>Ripeneſs</hi> of his <hi>Experience,</hi> and the ſedateſt Years of his Life, ſhould be ſeiz'd with all thoſe inexcuſable <hi>Tricks</hi> of

But if <hi>Mother Abbeſs</hi> ſhould chance to 'wake, Mr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> what a miſerable <hi>plight</hi> wou'd you be in!

               <p>Here we ſhould have the Happineſs of <hi>ingenious</hi> and <hi>religious Converſation:</hi> We would keep the <hi>Doors</hi> ſo faſt, that none of your ſcandalous <hi>Sex,</hi> nor <hi>Scandal</hi> it ſelf, would enter: We would employ our ſelves in nothing but <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>diverting Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of <hi>Devotion: Improve</hi> our <hi>Minds, Exerciſe,</hi> and thereby <hi>ſtrengthen</hi>

               </byline>
               <p>I Can't tell whether you'll be ſo <hi>Charitable</hi> to give me <hi>Credit</hi> if I ſhou'd aſſure you I am not yet in a <hi>Longing Condition,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably never may be, and therefore mayn't perhaps ſufficiently <hi>underſtand</hi> the <hi>Subject</hi> to give you a compleat Anſwer. But when you fall thus <hi>fouly</hi> on our <hi>Sex</hi> only for being <hi>Women,</hi> when you are ſo <hi>diſingenuous,</hi> and ſo <hi>unnatural</hi> to accuſe 'em for what's no more in their own <hi>power</hi> than thoſe other <hi>Miſeries</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> which but for <hi>you</hi> they cou'd never know; 'tis then a <hi>Common Cauſe,</hi> and we are all <hi>engag'd</hi> in't, and muſt try according to the beſt of our knowledge to <hi>defend</hi> one another.</p>
               <p>And in the firſt place then, how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you pretend to <hi>hedge</hi> your <hi>Betts,</hi> 'tis a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41990:176"/>clear Caſe that if this be a <hi>miſchief,</hi> it is to <hi>your ſelves</hi> that its <hi>Original</hi> is owing: 'Tis the <hi>perverſeneſs</hi> of your <hi>own Sex</hi> wherewith you have <hi>infected ours;</hi> all other <hi>Longing</hi> is but <hi>trifling,</hi> ſome little <hi>Qualms</hi> which we owe to our <hi>Fathers,</hi> and brought with us from them into the World. Moſt of the <hi>Inſtances</hi> you bring, do evidently relate to your own <hi>handy-work.</hi> Much in the ſame manner you deal with thoſe of <hi>our Sex,</hi> who without ſomething <hi>ſurer</hi> than your own <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Honours,</hi> have no more <hi>Wit</hi> or <hi>Vertue</hi> than to believe you; firſt <hi>ruine</hi> 'em, and then <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult</hi> over 'em. And when we have you as <hi>faſt</hi> as the Laws of Heaven and Earth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether can <hi>hold</hi> ye, what <hi>ſtrange Creatures</hi> do you quickly make us? Our <hi>Beauty</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, almoſt as ſoon as you <hi>blow</hi> upon it; our <hi>Complexion,</hi> our <hi>Shape,</hi> our <hi>Health</hi> is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ruin'd; we contract a <hi>Hundred Diſeaſes,</hi> which we owe either to your <hi>Vice,</hi> or at leaſt to your <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> we undergo the moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Pains,</hi> and the greateſt <hi>Hazards,</hi> and often more than <hi>die</hi> for every <hi>Child</hi> is born you; and theſe are your <hi>Thanks,</hi> this your <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> theſe the <hi>Generous Returns</hi> you make for all we endure for <hi>your Satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wou'd any be in <hi>pain</hi> unleſs they cou'd <hi>help</hi> it, or mortally <hi>tormented,</hi> and run the imminent <hi>hazard</hi> of their <hi>Lives,</hi> if they knew how to <hi>avoid</hi> it? What <hi>Pleaſure</hi> is it to <hi>Long,</hi> any more than to be <hi>Hungry?</hi> We are forc'd for the ſake of <hi>Decency</hi> to put a conſtant <hi>Violence</hi> upon our <hi>Nature</hi> on theſe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41990:176"/>
                  <hi>Occaſions.</hi> Are your <hi>Minds</hi> indeed as you boaſt, ſo much <hi>ſtronger</hi> than <hi>ours?</hi> Has your <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſo abſolute a Command over your <hi>Appetites?</hi> Let us then ſee <hi>you</hi> refuſe a <hi>Glaſs</hi> of <hi>Delicious Wine ſparkling</hi> before ye, when you are juſt ready to die for <hi>Thirſt:</hi> We do this and more, and for <hi>you,</hi> and often <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat</hi> theſe and greater pieces of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> and thus it is you Reward us.</p>
               <p>If 'tis ſo <hi>painful,</hi> as you ſeem to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to be <hi>deſpis'd</hi> and <hi>ridicul'd,</hi> why do you treat us in that manner your ſelves, when you have firſt <hi>expos'd</hi> us to all that know us? If we <hi>Long</hi> ſometimes for ſuch things as are <hi>nauſeous</hi> and frightful by the common Rule of <hi>Taſte,</hi> this is a <hi>demonſtration</hi> that from the very beginning, 'tis not in our <hi>power</hi> to <hi>avoid</hi> it. Were it only for the beſt <hi>Viands,</hi> and moſt <hi>Delicious Dainties,</hi> you wou'd have ſome <hi>Pretence</hi> to think ours was no <hi>more;</hi> but when you <hi>acknowledge</hi> the <hi>contrary,</hi> one wou'd think you might be contented with your <hi>own Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You had pleaded enough for us already, but you ſtill extend your <hi>Kindneſs</hi> farther, and alledge another Argument, which proves as ſtrongly as the <hi>laſt,</hi> that this troubleſome <hi>Affection</hi> of many of our <hi>Sex,</hi> when in that <hi>Condition,</hi> is perfectly <hi>involuntary:</hi> And that is, that it often <hi>injures</hi> our <hi>Children,</hi> which are <hi>parts</hi> of our <hi>own Bodies:</hi> Well, and are we ſo <hi>unnatural</hi> to do this out of <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Choice?</hi> Wou'd any <hi>Mother</hi> chooſe to have a Child <hi>deform'd</hi> and <hi>monſtrous?</hi> But there's
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41990:177"/>more than this in the caſe, for both <hi>Child</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> not rarely loſe their Lives on theſe <hi>Occaſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be, you'll ſay, they were <hi>deſperate.</hi> Yes, it may be the ill Uſage of the <hi>Brute</hi> their Husband made the <hi>miſerables</hi> deſirous to leave the World, and not leave any of their unhappy <hi>Race</hi> behind 'em. But you cannot ſay it is always ſo, for we muſt be ſo juſt to <hi>Mankind,</hi> to acknowledge there are ſome few who know better how to <hi>value</hi> us, who have a juſter <hi>tenderneſs</hi> for us, and from whom we meet with <hi>fairer <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I'm miſtaken if ſuch as theſe think much of every <hi>Glaſs</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> that goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their own <hi>Inſatiable Weaſand;</hi> or are ſo extreamly <hi>Thrifty,</hi> as not to allow their <hi>t'other ſelf,</hi> what a <hi>Friend,</hi> nay, a <hi>Servant</hi> has every day at his Command.</p>
               <p>But if you are of that Mind, good Mr. <hi>H.</hi> never ſpoil <hi>two Families;</hi> let the <hi>Widow</hi> you wot of alone, and diſturb her no <hi>further:</hi> Be contented that you have <hi>turn'd one Wife</hi> over, and got <hi>rid</hi> of her by one means or another: But if you think to make your <hi>Court</hi> to a <hi>Second</hi> in this manner, certainly unleſs ſhe <hi>Longs</hi> already, and that for ſome ſuch odd things you were lately <hi>diſcourſing</hi> of, ſhe'll never <hi>take</hi> you to ſave her from <hi>Miſcarrying;</hi> for <hi>all Women</hi> don't <hi>doat</hi> on ſuch as you ſpeak of, tho' ſometimes the <hi>Proverb</hi> helps 'em.</p>
               <p>If we have this <hi>Diſcaſe</hi> from our <hi>Cradles,</hi> which on my word if it be true, is a rare
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41990:177"/>Diſcovery in <hi>Nature,</hi> why then are you ſo unjuſt as to bear ſo hard upon us for what, for that further Reaſon, we cannot <hi>alter?</hi> Why don't you <hi>chide</hi> your <hi>ſelves,</hi> or your <hi>Friends</hi> for bringing the <hi>Gout,</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> or other Hereditary Diſtempers with 'em in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World? Which if it be true, never blame 'em as if their own <hi>Extravagancy</hi> had <hi>pull'd</hi> 'em on them.</p>
               <p>But no <hi>Creature Longs</hi> but <hi>Woman:</hi> The more <hi>unhappy</hi> ſhe then, and the more <hi>pity</hi> does ſhe deſerve. But are you in earneſt, Mr. <hi>H?</hi> Did you never hear of <hi>Men</hi> that <hi>long'd</hi> too, and that as <hi>paſſionately</hi> and <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently</hi> as any of thoſe whom they <hi>deſpiſe</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> for the ſame <hi>Reaſon:</hi> Nay, even for thoſe very <hi>Perſons,</hi> at leaſt their <hi>Fortunes,</hi> and had Infallibly <hi>miſcarry'd,</hi> had <hi>hang'd</hi> or <hi>ſtabb'd</hi> themſelves (or elſe they are luſtily <hi>Perjur'd</hi>) if they had not <hi>obtain'd</hi> 'em.</p>
               <p>But more than this, <hi>Men</hi> have <hi>long'd</hi> for ſome of thoſe ſilly things for which they make ſuch loud out-cries on the <hi>poor Women,</hi> for <hi>Fruit,</hi> for a <hi>Diſh</hi> of <hi>Meat,</hi> and twenty other things, after which their <hi>depraved Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites</hi> have <hi>rambled</hi> to that degree, that they have <hi>ſwoon'd</hi> away when diſappointed. And when they'll aſſign us a Reaſon of ſuch an odd <hi>Effect,</hi> as well as of thoſe ridiculous <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathies</hi> which diſturb many <hi>Men</hi> all their <hi>Lives,</hi> then we Promiſe to give 'em <hi>another,</hi> and a <hi>better,</hi> why <hi>Teeming Women</hi> are ſo often <hi>afflicted</hi> with <hi>Longing,</hi> contrary to their own <hi>deſires.</hi>

               <p>AFter the innumerable <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> whereof your <hi>vexations Sex</hi> are the <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Authors,</hi> ſome of which I have endeavour'd to ſet in a <hi>juſt light,</hi> that the World may <hi>beware</hi> both of <hi>them</hi> and <hi>you,</hi> I ſhall end as I began with <hi>Love,</hi> the moſt <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>fatal</hi> of 'em all, and take my leave of that and you together. And that I may not only diſcover this Epidemical Diſtemper, but like a good Phyſician, apply ſome Remedies to thoſe who are <hi>viſited</hi> with it, I intend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my preſent Addreſs to your moſt <hi>egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Vanities,</hi> with a few choice <hi>Receipts</hi> for the <hi>Cure</hi> of this Fatal Paſſion, which if ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken time enough, is not perhaps ſo impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as you wou'd have us imagine.</p>
               <p>And in order to this deſirable Alteration on all ſuch as are not yet quite paſt hope, I muſt firſt adviſe 'em to remove the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> which I cou'd never find was any other than an <hi>Idle</hi> and <hi>wretchleſs diſpoſition. Lazineſs</hi> is as near a-kin to <hi>Love,</hi> as a <hi>Fever</hi> is to an <hi>Ague;</hi> and I verily believe that <hi>hard Working</hi> wou'd be as good a <hi>Cure</hi> for one as 'tis for

               <p>But I talk on this Subject like a <hi>Lover</hi> who is commending his <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> and ſcarce know when I've done. Let's leave this therefore, which I look on as the moſt <hi>Effectual Remedy</hi> of any other, and proceed to enquire what further <hi>helps</hi> may be found againſt ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a <hi>Diſtemper.</hi>

               <p>There was an <hi>honeſt old rough Fellow</hi> among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who being ask'd what <hi>Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> ſhou'd be us'd for one in <hi>Love?</hi> He bluntly aſſign'd only theſe three following: Either, ſays he, let 'em <hi>Fast</hi> it out, or let <hi>Time</hi> Cure it, or if both theſe fail, there's no <hi>Cure</hi> but <hi>one,</hi> and that's a <hi>Halter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two <hi>first</hi> will be thought too groſs for the <hi>nice Pallats</hi> of our <hi>Silken Gallants,</hi> yet if they are wiſe, they'll rather make uſe of 'em, than come to the laſt, which however muſt be confeſs'd that many of their <hi>Tribe</hi> have found <hi>Infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they wou'd ſtop ſhort of this laſt, let 'em uſe others leſs <hi>violent,</hi> e're the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> be arriv'd to too great an height. Let 'em <hi>fly</hi> from the fair <hi>Cockatrice</hi>— ſhut their <hi>Eyes,</hi> their very <hi>Souls,</hi> their Memories, their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations. Turn her out, never ſo much as <hi>Dream</hi> of her, at leaſt without <hi>chiding</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves afterward. Never <hi>talk</hi> of her, nor let others do it in their hearing, or <hi>fly</hi> ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and even all thoſe who are themſelves in <hi>Love,</hi> and be as careful to <hi>weather</hi> 'em as you wou'd one that was newly come out of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41990:179"/>a <hi>Peſt-houſe,</hi> and ſcatter'd Infection, Plague, and certain Fate around 'em. Fly your <hi>Country,</hi> as you wou'd for any other <hi>Tyrant,</hi> or if it were infected with continual <hi>Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi> For <hi>change</hi> of <hi>Air</hi> is ſometimes as <hi>wholeſome</hi> to the <hi>Mind</hi> as 'tis to the <hi>Body.</hi> Don't <hi>think</hi> of her tho' you can't <hi>help</hi> it; that is, <hi>reſolve</hi> you <hi>will</hi> not, tho' you <hi>do,</hi> and <hi>muſt</hi> at preſent, for in time at leaſt you'll get <hi>ſome Ground,</hi> and if it be never ſo <hi>little</hi> at firſt, your <hi>Heart</hi> will by degrees be all your <hi>own.</hi> If ſhe intrude never ſo often, tell her, ſhe has nothing to do there, her Reign's at an end, and drive her out, as you wou'd a <hi>Fury.</hi> Think how like a Fool you look, and how many Monkey-tricks this Love makes you play daily. Conſider what you get if you obtain your deſires, either to be fairly <hi>cheated,</hi> and turn'd off to make room for ſome new Fool, or <hi>tir'd</hi> with an odious <hi>Satiety,</hi> or at beſt, pay <hi>dear</hi> for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> To all which, do but add a real <hi>will</hi> to be cur'd, and a firm belief that you may be ſo, and (believe one that has try'd) your <hi>Recovery</hi> is more than half perfected.</p>

Delight, and Joy, and even <hi>Hope</hi> are its near <hi>Allies,</hi> there's a ſtrict <hi>Confederacy</hi> between them, you can never hope to ſever 'em, and they'll certainly run the <hi>ſame Fortune.</hi> You wou'd make your ſelf incapable of <hi>Senſe</hi> as well as <hi>Happineſs,</hi> render all you <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>taſt,</hi> inſipid and <hi>indifferent;</hi> reduce your ſelves to the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41990:180"/>condition of a <hi>Stone</hi> or a <hi>Log,</hi> and what's that better than <hi>being nothing?</hi> I expect in your next Eſſay that you ſhou'd publiſh ſome <hi>Choice Remedies</hi> againſt the <hi>Fatigue</hi> of Breathing, and give us ſome of the moſt ſpeedy and Infallible ways to <hi>Cure</hi> the great <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> of <hi>Life:</hi> Tho' I ſhou'd think 'twou'd be a more <hi>Friendly Employment</hi> to let us know how we might <hi>Improve Life, ſweeten</hi> it, and make the <hi>best</hi> on't, and doubly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all its <hi>Innocent Satisfactions:</hi> And I'm miſtaken if a Vertuous and <hi>Honourable Love</hi> will not produce all theſe <hi>Happy Effects,</hi> and a great many others which I have not nam'd, For whether or no 'twill make us more <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,</hi> as <hi>Lady Single</hi> is at laſt convinc'd by ſuch another <hi>Railmore</hi> as your ſelf; this is certain, that 'twill make any Perſon more <hi>careful</hi> to <hi>appear</hi> ſo; it has chang'd the moſt <hi>Remarkable Slovens</hi> into <hi>Compleat Gentlemen,</hi> it <hi>refines</hi> the <hi>Manners,</hi> and <hi>ſoftens</hi> and gilds the <hi>Converſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this having been already better manag'd by other <hi>Hands,</hi> I ſhall rather chooſe to <hi>cloſe</hi> the <hi>Campaign</hi> with an Attempt to force your <hi>Line,</hi> to level all the <hi>Entrenchments</hi> you have made againſt this Powerful God, nay, to take you <hi>Priſoner,</hi> and ſhow you how you may be <hi>Happy</hi> whether you will or no, which you can never be compleatly, unleſs you <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the firſt great <hi>Secret</hi> in the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> is <hi>Love</hi> it ſelf, how great a Paradox ſoever that may appear: My meaning is, that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41990:181"/>any one who deſires to be <hi>lov'd,</hi> muſt himſelf <hi>Love</hi> with all his might, and to the utmoſt of his <hi>Power;</hi> for there is no ſuch <hi>Charm</hi> for <hi>Love,</hi> as <hi>Love,</hi> reſolv'd, vigorous, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, which is almoſt irreſiſtible.

               </p>
               <p>And when you have once begun the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack,</hi> be ſure you <hi>puſh</hi> it <hi>home,</hi> regarding no <hi>conſequences,</hi> but that your <hi>Intentions</hi> be <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable</hi> and <hi>Vertuous,</hi> without which, <hi>Love</hi> it ſelf is but a <hi>Dream</hi> of <hi>Happineſs.</hi> Take care your Addreſſes be <hi>Lawful,</hi> and then the <hi>warmer</hi> the <hi>better;</hi> for <hi>none</hi> of our <hi>Sex</hi> but <hi>hate a luke-warm Zealous Love,</hi> which is of it ſelf ſo <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>active</hi> a <hi>Paſſion,</hi> that where the <hi>Pretender</hi> is <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>heavy,</hi> how ſhou'd he make us believe he's in <hi>Love</hi> at <hi>all,</hi> any more than that there's any <hi>Fire</hi> where we ſee nothing but <hi>Aſhes,</hi> not the leaſt <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi> of Heat or <hi>Motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You can't think I mean the Old Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick way of down-right <hi>dangling</hi> for a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,</hi> or that the poor enamour'd Knight ſhou'd lug out cold <hi>Iron,</hi> and make a <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi> in his <hi>Breaſt,</hi> that the <hi>obdurate Lady</hi> might ſee what a <hi>huge Hole</hi> he has in his Heart: No, this is now as juſtly <hi>ridiculous</hi> as powdering a Miſtreſs all over with <hi>Ruby</hi> and <hi>Diamond:</hi> Or the other Extream, the Lub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Gallant's <hi>lolling</hi> upon a <hi>Couch, Courting</hi> none but his <hi>ſweet ſelf;</hi> or if he can afford a word or two, only <hi>makes Love</hi> in <hi>ſtylo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citativo,</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:41990:181"/>and humms out a few ends of Verſe, or <hi>Scraps</hi> of Songs, as if he thought our <hi>Hearts</hi> were to be <hi>won</hi> the ſame way they took of old, by <hi>Muttering</hi> and <hi>Incantation:</hi> But 'tis the <hi>middle way</hi> between both of theſe that can only expect to be <hi>proſperous,</hi> and the ſame <hi>application</hi> of Mind is here requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that is neceſſary in any other Affair of equal <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>moment,</hi> and whereon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of a Man's <hi>whole Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor muſt this be only for a <hi>ſpurt</hi> and away, we ſhou'd be Cowards indeed, ſhou'd we yield at the firſt <hi>Summons,</hi> and you'd think us very ill provided, cou'd we not beat ye off the firſt <hi>Storm.</hi> You will not let us be ingenuous if we had a mind to't: You hate a cheap <hi>Conquest,</hi> and part with it as eaſily as you <hi>gain'd</hi> it.

               </p>
               <p>But yet at the ſame time we'd have ye <hi>importunate,</hi> you muſt take care to find the way not to be <hi>troubleſome.</hi> You muſt not turn your <hi>Courtſhip</hi> into a <hi>Perſecution.</hi> You muſt give us ſome ſpace to <hi>breath</hi> in, and to conſider of <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render,</hi> which you may ſafely allow, ſo the <hi>Truce</hi> be not over-long; which will <hi>retard</hi> your <hi>Approaches,</hi> and make us think you mean to <hi>Raiſe</hi> the <hi>Siege,</hi> and that you either
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41990:182"/>deſpair of <hi>Conquest,</hi> or do not think us worth your <hi>Labour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And more than all this, we expect you ſhou'd <hi>treat</hi> us very <hi>fairly,</hi> and <hi>humour</hi> us at leaſt before we <hi>yield,</hi> and we think we have reaſon, for we know 'twill be your <hi>time</hi> afterwards.

Such a ſhort <hi>Diſguiſe</hi> one wou'd think ſhou'd be a <hi>Diverſion</hi> t' ye, ſince there's no fear you ſhou'd get a Habit on't; but <hi>Nature</hi> will break out ſome time or other, and we muſt be that <hi>all</hi> our <hi>Lives</hi> to pleaſe you, which you with ſo much <hi>violence</hi> to your ſelves appear to be, in order to oblige us for a few hours only.</p>
               <p>Tho' if by endeavouring to <hi>gain</hi> your <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> you ſhou'd alſo <hi>regain</hi> your ſelves; if by <hi>ſtriving</hi> ſo earneſtly to <hi>pleaſe</hi> us, you come at laſt to be really <hi>like</hi> us; if by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving continually before you the Charming <hi>Idea's</hi> of <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> Complaiſance, <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Humility,</hi> Compaſſion, and Goodneſs, you ſhou'd become e're you were aware, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected</hi> with thoſe <hi>Vertues,</hi> and <hi>wonder</hi> at the change without <hi>comprehending</hi> it; you'd yet have no Reaſon ſurely to complain of the Alteration.</p>

               <p>THIS is now the ſecond time I have told you in Print, that you Women are the oddeſt things in Nature; if any one of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity tells you of their Eſteem, you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently deſpiſe him, but your manner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is wonderfully particular, your Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage uncommon, and your Action ſo full of unmannerly Pride, that ſhou'd my Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man have the Eſteem I had for you, I ſhou'd conclude him Fool, and diſcharge him of my Service. I had the Opinion you were Miſtreſs of ſome Underſtanding, and more Goodneſs, and that Opinion laid me open
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41990:183"/>to an Impreſſion troubleſome enough, but the brutiſh returns made me, has raſed that Character, and ſtain'd every drop of Blood I have, with the much truer one of haughty, inſolently proud and vain. <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Vain</hi> were given you in your earlier Age, and then you were excuſeable; but in <hi>declining Years,</hi> when ſcarce any thing but Goodneſs is left to recommend you, to double the Humour, is intolerable. You think poſſibly the Title of Sir — and my Lady's Daughter, a Coach, and the Reputation of a Thouſand Pounds a Year, (tho' ſomething over-valued) with the Acquaintance of a Neighbouring Earl or two, entitle you to your Phantaſtick Air, your haughty <hi>Toſs</hi> and <hi>Step,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe implicitly all without the Title of my Lord, Sir — or your Ladyſhip. I'm ſure this Opinion ſuits your Meen, and I miſtake if not your Underſtanding, and in Complaiſance take this Wiſh at parting — May your Pride have the lofty Title, and the empty thing familiarly tack'd to it, and may that Idoliz'd Title be your only Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and be aſſur'd when next you make my Proſpect a Contemning Smile, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me, that towring Vanity in her proudeſt dreſs muſt down, tho' ſet in Beauty; that the Beggar will level with us all, and have ſix Foot of Ground as good as the proudeſt ſhe; nay, perhaps better; for <hi>Osborn</hi> ſays, which you had known had you conſulted Books half ſo much as your Looking-Glaſs, <hi>He that lies under the Herſe of Heaven is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41990:184"/>but to tell you you were <hi>Old</hi> too, if you'd pleaſe ingenuouſly to confeſs, this makes it <hi>ſting</hi> deeper than all the reſt; and did you not need all the Goodneſs your Lover ſays you are Miſtreſs of, to forgive it: However, if your Ladyſhip thinks fit to take our fooliſh Opinion in this matter, We think you may honourably enough forgive him, for this Reaſon, becauſe you are not to believe one word that a Lover ſays or writes either for or againſt you, ſince that Arch Wag <hi>Cupid</hi> as ſoon as e're he has caught 'em, puts his own <hi>Muffler</hi> about their <hi>Eyes,</hi> and make 'em play at <hi>Blind-man's-Buff,</hi> running about like Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks, feeling and ſtumbling, and breaking their own <hi>Noſes</hi> and <hi>Shins,</hi> and other Folks, and woe to them that ſtand in their way, or come within their Clutches.

Nor need you do more, we think, effectually
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41990:184"/>to mortifie him, than now and then to ſhow him his Letter, and when he ſues for any Favour — a Touch or Kiſs — of your Hand — remember him you are — Old — Keep him thus at Eyes-end and Lips end but for a Week or a Fortnight, and we'll Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for him he becomes as true a Humble Spaniel-Lover as any in Chriſtendom.</p>

               <p>THrough the Univerſal Charity and Good Will I bear to my fellow-Creatures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently of either Sex, I have been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hope that one day Men wou'd become <hi>ſuch lovers of Truth and Juſtice,</hi> and ſo free from the Natural Prejudices of Self-love, as to allow of, and be pleaſed with the many good Qualities in ours, and leave off their malicious and groundleſs Reproaches; tho' I think I may be allowed to ſpeak in the Defence of oppreſſed Innocency, ſince I ſee there's but little probability of a change in our Enemies; for one can hardly paſs <hi>a Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller's Shop,</hi> without ſeeing ſomething upon the Stall againſt us; nor be in a Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſome of the <hi>wou'd be Wits</hi> muſt ridicule our Sex, 'tis even become as faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable an Error as 'tis to laugh at <hi>Prieſt-craft, or Religion</hi> it ſelf. Perhaps our Adverſaries may tell us, 'tis an Argument for their being in the right; that 'tis not only the Opinion of ſome, but almoſt all: To which we An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41990:188"/>That will prove nothing in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſince 'tis ſo common to be miſtaken in the Judgments made of things, that there is <hi>but here and there a wiſe Man that can diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Truth from Falſhood;</hi> and eſpecially in ſuch caſes as this, where they imagine their Intereſt concerned; for ſhou'd it be once own'd by 'em, that we have as great a ſhare <hi>in Vertue, Prudence, Affability, Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and whatever may render Society agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as they themſelves have, what appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Reaſon cou'd they bring for treating us ſo deſpicably and <hi>unmannerly</hi> as they do? But they think by that means to make us have an ill Opinion of our ſelves, through a miſtaken Policy, believing that then we ſhall the more eaſily ſubmit to their Yoke; which is doubtleſs an Error, for <hi>every wiſe Woman will obey the reaſonable Commands of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> ſince not only her Duty, but the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of our Country oblige her to it, both for her own and his Reputation. And what Excuſe cou'd a falſe and treacherous Lover, or Ill-natur'd, Vicious, <hi>Fantaſtical Husband</hi> find, but by endeavouring to make us as like 'em as poſſible? And thus by throwing their faults upon us, they think they juſtifie and clear themſelves. Which of 'em our preſent Enemy is, I won't determine, yet methinks he writes with ſo much <hi>eagerneſs and fury,</hi> that he muſt needs have a tang of one of theſe Perfections; nay, I believe hardly ever any Perſon under other Circumſtances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared againſt us; for tho' a deſerving Man
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41990:188"/>may be forſaken, or a <hi>good Husband ill treated</hi> (for I won't pretend to juſtifie all my Sex) yet they will immediately reflect, that 'tis their Misfortune, and not falſly conclude all Women are baſe and ungrateful, becauſe they have found ſome ſo. And that our Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt has more Malice than Truth of his ſide, we ſhall ſoon find by Examination: He gives us not one Inſtance of our <hi>Variouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as he calls it, but we can give a good Reaſon for it, or ſhew the Men to equal, if not exceed us; — <hi>We change our Servants,</hi> why not where they're undeſerving? Our Humours, I believe there will be no need of proving that we are always more Obliging, Courteous, and ready to do good Services to others, than you are; leſs reſenting, and more eaſie to forgive. If there's any <hi>Place of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Profit to be gain'd, he's the ſureſt to ſucceed, who makes the Ladies his Friends;</hi> for where they Promiſe any Service, or Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office, they are indefatigable till 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. Let any one that Affronts us, but acknowledge the Fault, and beg Pardon, we are reconcil'd, whereas nothing <hi>but Blood can quiet your Revenge.— <hi>Our Lovers,</hi>
                  </hi> Ay, there you gain the Point; we yield, we yield; perhaps here and there a Lady may find rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to diſcard a Lover or two in her whole Life, becauſe of the diſadvantages we lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in that Affair, ſince we han't the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of chooſing where we pleaſe, but by Cuſtom are obliged to accept of ſuch as offer themſelves, therefore may ſometimes chance
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41990:189"/>to admit a Lover, whoſe Imperfections once diſcovered, will in ſome meaſure <hi>juſtifie this change;</hi> but you, poor Souls, are ſuch <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, pretty, whining things, that for fear of miſſing of being Happy in ſome, you'll Court the whole Sex,</hi> and are true to one, but till you ſee the next Face; and ſuch a value you put upon theſe Conqueſts, that he that has <hi>betray'd half a dozen Ladies,</hi> thinks he has done more to brag of than <hi>Alexander.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Love, when placed on a worthy Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is great and laſting; <hi>David</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges it as ſuch, and we have <hi>more Examples in Hiſtory of the ſurprizing and conſtant Love of Women to their Husbands, than of Men to their Wives:</hi> Nay, in our time, to hear of a Wife that's indifferent (till Weather-beaten to't) is very rare; whereas moſt Men impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declare, <hi>there's no Love after Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi>— Well, but <hi>we alter our Faſhions,</hi> the Men do juſt the ſame; <hi>and our Complexions, Eyes,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>SURE 'tis either for your Eaſe or Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, you go ſo far out of your way to conſider, <hi>Whether Women ſhou'd be learn'd,</hi> ſo little Senſe and Judgment as you allow 'em, ſhou'd methinks put 'em out of the danger, and then of what uſe is all your Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for fear we ſhou'd beyond expectation attain to <hi>any Proficiency</hi> in a thing ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, hurtful, and inconvenient to our ſelves, and you, I fear <hi>your Apprehenſion has been too quick for your Judgment,</hi> to ſuffer you to run away with ſuch a Miſtake.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:41990:192"/>
               <p>By your leave, Sir, I think 'tis no <hi>equal Abſurdity,</hi> a Woman's Ambition to raiſe her ſelf above her Sex, and ſuppoſe ſhe cou'd do't; as for a Man ſo <hi>meanly to degrade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> that when deſign'd for ſuch Great and Noble Employments, he ſhou'd be content with the moſt contemptible of <hi>Female Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and become a Spinſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We're oblig'd to you for telling us the way of attaining <hi>any good degree of Science; you ſay, it requires a quick Apprehenſion, ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Judgment, an unweary'd Diligence, an unſhaken Conſtancy, an indefatigable Induſtry;</hi> all which Vertues, whatever you may think, are no ſtrangers to our Sex, nor againſt our Natures, as perhaps the <hi>Stationer</hi> by his Reading may know better than you with all your Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>We envy not your <hi>ſtrong Dogs Stomach to digeſt</hi> thoſe hard Bones of Philoſophy, and the Cauſes of Things, <hi>We can content our ſelves with gueſſing, which is as far as you can go, and our puny Nut-ſhells will contain as many may-be's as yours;</hi> and you're not ſo ſure of all <hi>knowables Divine and Humane,</hi> but that with ſome degree of Application we can go as far as you, and in the Practick part of Divinity, <hi>far out go you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I can't deny the facility <hi>a large Genius</hi> may give to Learning, but ſuppoſe Womens ſhou'd be more contracted, dos't follow, they muſt deny their Genius all Improvement, and <hi>throw all away on Folly, Vanity, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Affairs, for fear of Shipwrack, when
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41990:193"/>they launch out into the vaſt Ocean of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> without your Inſurance, which we may be ſure you'll never give us whilſt under the Miſtake of <hi>believing we can't ſpell,</hi> and yet pretend to Learning, only becauſe 'tisn't ſo much our buſineſs as yours? A great ſign you do't ill, we've ſuch a mind to mend it.</p>
               <p>If <hi>a Woman's a Member of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Nature</hi> (which can't be deny'd) and ought to fill her Poſt, and diſcharge her Part as <hi>a Citizen of the World,</hi> ſhe'll have uſe enough of her Learning in her Converſe with Men, and <hi>ſo much Wit,</hi> no doubt, to employ't in <hi>regulating her Paſſions, exalting her Mind, and freeing't from Prejudice, Heat, and Obſtinacy,</hi> rather than apply 'em in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a <hi>Pudding, threading a Needle, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Domeſtick Affairs,</hi> knowing by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience how ill Men ſucceed when-ever they go by <hi>ſuch learn'd Rules to inſtruct their Wives in Family-Buſineſs,</hi> which does as ill become your Sex, as it does <hi>ours</hi> by Diſcourſe or Writing to pretend to <hi>Documentize our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Undoubtedly the Man that <hi>first taught us to Write,</hi> appears as wiſe, if not a little wiſer, and perhaps more juſt than thoſe, that for <hi>tenderneſs of ſpoiling Paper,</hi> (which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſerves for ſo many uſes) wou'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us to ſo ſevere a Puniſhment, as to deprive us of <hi>three Fingers,</hi> which wou'd for ever diſable us from <hi>making a Pudding, or threading a Needle,</hi> the higheſt Perfection of our <hi>Trifling Sex, according to Mr.</hi> Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acre.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:41990:193"/>
               <p>I'm ſurpriz'd to find a Man of ſo great Undertaking, as that confining our Sex's Scribling to a <hi>Billet-deux, or Paſſionate Love-Letter,</hi> ſhou'd at the ſame time be ſo afraid of us as to call in the <hi>help of Laws,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to bring <hi>Sureties for our Good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> and yet after all, can hardly think himſelf ſecure from <hi>ſcratching;</hi> you had better have ſecured your ſelf by Law before you had meddl'd with us; for 'tis not your Wife's being an ill <hi>Houſe-wife, and a Slut, will hinder us from ſcrawling and blotting Paper,</hi> and doing all thoſe things you'r ſo afraid of. Truly, Sir, you're miſtaken in this laſt, fear of our <hi>Old Cant of Improving our Minds, Cultivating our Heads, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing in Wiſdom,</hi> for now we're convinc'd of the Error, and perceive in you that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing works none of thoſe Effects.</p>
               <p>Nor ſhall we quarrel with you for the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary part of Learning,</hi> ſince we've, by your own Confeſſion, ſo much as enables us to <hi>make War with our Husbands when they invade our Priviledge or Prerogatives.</hi> And for that part of <hi>Ethicks, Mathematicks, and Muſick,</hi> your good Nature allows us, we return it you with many Thanks, for we've Naturally as much of thoſe as ſerves our Occaſions, for the <hi>Man I fear with all his Learning diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges his Duty to his Wife no better than the Wife to the Husband;</hi> and to require the Wife ſhou'd be <hi>tuned exactly to the Temper of her Husband,</hi> ſhews the weakneſs of his Reaſon,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41990:194"/>whilſt not that, but his Temper, muſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern both himſelf and Wife.</p>
               <p>I only beg a greater Liberty in <hi>Surgery and Phyſick,</hi> ſuppoſing 'tis none of your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, but that without danger you may grant it, for we ſhall neither <hi>Write nor Teach</hi> it, nor Practice on our Husbands, for there the Law ſecures you; nor ſhall <hi>Oeconomies</hi> be forgotten, if that will pleaſe you.</p>
               <p>But the hardeſt Task you impoſe, is to learn <hi>Rhetorick</hi> enough to put us to ſilence, and then give over; we're all fond of Praiſe, and a thing ſo commendable as the <hi>Art of Speaking,</hi> weighs more with us than the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Silence,</hi> 'twill be hard to ſtop us in a purſuit of ſo much Glory; if any thing prevail, it muſt be the only conſideration, that obſerving your Rules, the World muſt needs be very much oblig'd by ſuch <hi>a ſort of Learned Women.</hi>
